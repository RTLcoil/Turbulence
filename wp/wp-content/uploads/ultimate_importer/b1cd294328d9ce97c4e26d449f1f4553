He has been technical assistant to the film-maker Chris Marker, and collaborated with the companies Hyptique, Incandescence, Virtools, the BBC and more recently with violet. He creates specialised software, especially Xtras (plugins) of Adobe Director, like the asFFT Xtra. Since 1994, he has worked as a visual artist, recognised by numerous awards and exhibitions. Artist of the movement, digital artist, Schmitt develops his work around the notion of shapes ""programmed to be free"". His artworks, minimal, abstract and efficient, tackle contemporary or intemporal themes like the condition of being free, the systems of reality or the forces and their shape. He places programming, an artistic medium that he considers as radically new because of its active dimension, at the heart of the majority of his creations. Using techniques coming from artificial life and intelligence, influenced by philosophical and psychoanalytical approaches, Schmitt crafts objects or situations, generative or interactive physical, visual or audio systems, which question the modalities of the free human being in a complex world. Also, alone or though collaborations, Schmitt confronts his approach with more established artistic fields like dance, music, cinema, architecture or literature, and revisits their codes.",http://www.antoineschmitt.com/,as@gratin.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artem Baguinski,"Schoonoord, The Netherlands","Artem Baguinski was born November 17, 1976 in Cungur – a little town in Urals, Russia, 50 kilometres from the border between Europe and Asia. Until he was 13, he had no idea what direction his life would take, but in 1989, he received a comic book from his mother about computers which fatefully changed the course of his life. From that point on, he was constantly studying the art of telling machines what to do. Artem’s early learning was through the library and in computer club in school until 1993, when he entered the Moscow Power-Engineering Institute, where he studied system design and computer science. During his university years, his interests varied from artificial intelligence and statistics to complex systems, simulation, and computer aided software engineering. He received a bachelor degree in computer science in 1997 and continued his studies until 1999 when he received a computer systems engineer diploma and began working at a little enterprise in Smolensk, Russia, developing firmware for a SCADA system used in electric power systems, natural gas distributing systems, and in trains. At the same time, he was experimenting with programming computer graphics and music at home, in his free time - mostly at nights. Since the last years of his study, Artem has acquainted himself with the world of free software: GNU/Linux operating system. In a year, he passed the phases of initial curiosity about the phenomenon, enjoying freely available high-quality software and finally understanding the underlying principles and ideology. His first contributions to the free software world were translations of some documentation into Russian for the BestLinux distribution. In November 1999, Artem discovered on the Internet a new fascinating free software project - v2os - operating system written from scratch by the coder of the v2_lab, Joost Faassen. The OS was positioned as a perfect environment for demos, such as the little graphics and sound applications he was writing as a hobby, so he decided to give it a try. Not only did he want to use the OS, but he also tried to fix its problems that he kept running into. Two months later, he was hired by the lab and after another half year, moved to the Netherlands. Since then, Artem has worked as a programmer in the v2_lab, using his skills to help media artists make their dreams a reality. His areas of expertise are computer graphics, video programming and low-level programming in collaboration with Stock, the lab hardware engineer. He has also been involved in the CodeZebra project, designing system architecture and coordinating the work of the lab's CodeZebra team with the rest of the world.",https://github.com/artm,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Artists Meeting,"New York, NY, USA","Artists Meeting is a group of artists who create interventions and events. Through a series of discussions both online and in regular meetings, the group determines the viability of each project as it comes up and how to proceed. The process is partially by consensus but also depends on different members taking the lead or directing the project as it develops. Some processes demand a lot of hands in a group effort and reflect different ideas, other projects are executed according to a single vision. Often Artists Meeting projects begin as proposals to a selected venue, such as an art fair, gallery, or festival. This allows the group to imagine different approaches and determine parameters for the work. As the proposals are accepted the project is executed. Other projects remain unexecuted but often resurface as part of another proposal or in work that is in process. In other words nothing is ever lost. Every bit of information and creative energy is retrieved when appropriate.The group represents a range of creative talents including sculpture and installation artists, computer programmers and hackers, traditional painters, videographers, photographers, musicians, sound and performance artists. Some work is political and some is apolitical, but the assumption is that creating art in the face of all the obstacles facing artists is a political act. Artists Meeting began with the desire to expand the definition of art and the creative act using digital and traditional tools in a collaborative manner. Over the course of working together, the group methodology and style is constantly evolving.",http://artistsmeeting.org/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brigit Lichtenegger,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands","Brigit Lichtenegger (aka Evo Szuyuan): ""After studying industral design and theatre design, I started working as a software engineer in 1995. At the time this shift seemed to be an act of schizophreny, but it all started to make sense when I was given the opportunity to work at the media lab of V2_, Institute for the Unstable Media in 2001. For 5 years I worked there with great passion on a number of international collaborative art and research projects concerning interconnected multi-user environments, non-linear storytelling, 2D and 3D graphics, and developed an expertise in immersive and virtual reality environments. These include DataCloud 2 and 2.5, Amicitia, nybble-engine-toolZ, playList, GATC/life, taxi-onomy and The Mechanics of Emotions. In 2006 I started to work at the R&D department of Almende where I worked with computer scientists on projects concerning self-organization, artificial intelligence and wireless sensor networks. At the same time I kept working on art projects and was involved in organizing/curating lectures, workshops and seminars about perception, immersive environments and mixed realities. In november 2006, I got involved with the virtual world Second Life, and started exploring the potential of the platform as the avatar Evo Szuyuan. Initially drawn to the Second Life platform as a cheap means for protopying, I soon got involved in other ways as I was learning about places, people and projects that used the platform in interesting and innovative ways. In Second Life I started organizing and curating Dorkbot sessions, and in order to show the more interesting projects in this virtual world to a wider audience I started to document these using the so-called machinima technique. These videos were screened at the Rome Filmfest, nominated for several categories at the European Machinima Festival, and received with such enthousiasm, that I soon got overwhelmed with requests for them. In 2008 I left Almende and founded Creative Machinery, to be able to do the machinimatography for the project Fly me / Volavola"", for which 2 featurelength movies are made. One entirely shot in a virtual world, and the second in a mixed reality setup shot both in Second Life, and in Rome. Around the end of 2008 I started to work part time at CrossLab, the cross media lab of the Willem de Kooning arts academy. I'm also proud to be a member of Avatar Orchestra Metaverse, Not Possible in Real Life, and the Odyssey Art and Performance simulator.

Bulk Foodveyor ,"New York, NY, USA","""I've followed a linear path for the past fifteen years. I began doing experimental live-performed video, which gradually became a kind of narrative, media-based theater. Later, I lost interest in working live, and my present work has a resemblance to traditional moviemaking. Through all these phases of development, I have always used elements of physical assemblage, as well as a bizarre satirical humor. Assemblage always seemed an unparalleled imaginative outlet. Combine it with techniques purloined from the worlds of puppetry, theatrical illusion and video-graphic special effects, and the hidden lives of inert, neglected objects are revealed: an old, dirty dish-sponge becomes a jealous boyfriend; Styrofoam packing materials and broken kitchen implements are skyscrapers in bustling cities; a desiccated orange rind is a whirling dancer in a 1970s variety showcase; moth-eaten carpet-padding is a desert wasteland that a protagonist must traverse on horseback. This is not something I learned in academia or in any career venue.

Carole Kim,"Los Angeles, CA, USA","CAROLE KIM is an interdisciplinary artist with a focus on performance-based video installation combining digital/new media technologies and the sensitivity of the improvisational live performer/participant. The work emphasizes video’s capacity as a live medium and the illusory architecture of layered video projection in space. The moving image is spatially mapped onto a site, compositing in real space. The seamless cinematic distance of pre-edited film viewing is ruptured by the awareness that the moving image is being constructed in the moment. The more recent works have introduced the live presence of dancers into this layered landscape, mediating the body while preserving the dynamic edge of the live performer. The performances are immersive environments that often explore a de-centralized performance space that supports an integrated reciprocal exchange between sound, image, movement, space. She has exhibited and performed widely in the US and abroad. Venues include the Museum of Modern Art-New York, Museum of Contemporary Art-Los Angeles, REDCAT/Disney Hall, the Getty Center, Trampoline: Platform for New Media Art (Nottingham, England), the Stanford Jazz Festival, Engine 27 (New York), Arizona State University-West Interdisciplinary Arts & Performance Program (Phoenix, AZ), the Knitting Factory (LA), ArtSonje Center (Seoul, Korea) plus numerous festivals and performance series.

Christine Baczewska,"New York, NY, USA","As befits one who took her degree in English literature for fear of having too much sheer fun in the study of music, Baczewska's solo compositions derive essentially from an a capella sensibility, the voice as orchestra with consonants, pause and juncture, the click of affricatives as primary, if not sole, percussion. In 1974, she was co-founder of Care of the Cow, a cutting-edge performance group which developed quite a following through the early 1980s. During 1981's Like Feeding Pork to Pigs, Baczewska had a breakthrough: the home of the human voice is the brain. Ultimately, the expanding voice can be made to take any shape, fill any space, or convey any message. Her focus on the voice and solo performance evolves from this experience. She has concertized extensively and has recently worked on several important collaborations: with video artist Irit Batsry on vocals for video soundtracks; with Fritz Lang, to compose and perform the soundtrack for Lang's film Woman in the Moon: and, with dancer/choreographer Dennis O'Connor (with whose company she toured the United States and Europe in 1994.)

Eric Schefter,"New York, NY, USA","Eric Schefter was born in New Rochelle, NY in 1963, He received a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Film and Video from New York University in 1987. While studying at NYU his interests shifted from narrative film forms to abstract video and audio work. After graduating he produced his first video/audio installation Flow/Flux 88, supported in part by a Paul Lambert Video Production Award Grant. In order to approach electronic based art as a fluid medium (e.g. painting) he then began to acquire the tools necessary to create the work outside of the pressures of commercial studios. In 1989 he co organized, with two other artists, XFH, an artist run gallery and petrie dish for underground culture in New York City. There he curated film and video screenings, and created several audio and video installations. Through XFH, Eric met electronic musician Charles Cohen, with whom he formed The Luminists in 1990. Elaborating upon previous experiments with highly processed video feedback, Eric took his work out of the context of the studio into a live performance milieu. With The Luminists he began developing real-time improvisations of abstract video and audio, performed live in front of an audience In early 1991, Eric co founded the intermedia performance group 77 Hz (with Benton Bainbridge, Phil Bonner, Jonathan Giles, and Michael Schell). 77 Hz was primarily a performance project featuring live creation and manipulation of video images, combined with electronic music and theatrical performances. Also in 1991 he was an artist-in-residence at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University, and completed the video wall tape Burning Bush. In 1992 Eric Co-founded ESMP (Evolution of Sensory and Metabolic Probabilities) with MR Petit & P. Bonner, a multimedia performance group, utilizing electronic music, computer processed video, and anthropomorphic robotics. Eric left 77 Hz in 1993, and formed another performance duo, Diver Gone, with Jonathan Giles in 1994. Diver Gone worked with electronic media but the impulses were more DADA collage than previous projects: they often worked with visual and aural cut-ups of obscure popular culture. Eric ventured into the medium of CD ROM in 1995, co producing North Country an interactive narrative written by Helen Thorington and produced by New Radio and Performing Arts. He later co-created (design and HTML programming) the World Wide Web version of North Country, as well as assisting with the Turbulence Artist's Web Site and designing the interface for Turbulence's 9 Points of Entry project. In 1997 Eric moved from New York to Berlin, Germany and began work with choreographer and intermedia director Frauke Havemann. He has been technical director of Havemann's productions starting with Tripping on the Tongue in 1998 until the present day. In 2000 they collaborated on the video installations Lizard's Lounge and Excerpts From. In 2002 they formed the production group ON AIR (www.onairproductions.info) with performer Neal Wach. Since then, a series of works have been developed which investigate the flux and friction between Live-performance (human time, transformation/ change) and pre-recorded material (mechanical/digital time, the option for endless repetition). Within these parameters of narrative and multi-layered montage the audience becomes co-producer, co-writer, co-storyteller. Performances include Hotel Radio (2002), Leatherback (2004) and Truckers and Trackers (2006), as well as the installations Carwash (2002) and A Number (2007). ON AIR has performed in numerous festivals and performance spaces throughout Europe. Since 1998 he has also worked as a video and film editor in Germany on documentary films such as.

John Hudak,"Dobbs Ferry, NY, USA","John Hudak has been interested in sound and music from the age of four, when he began to play a variety of instruments. At the University of Delaware and the Naropa Institute for the Arts, he studied English, video, photography, creative writing and dance. John then began to create taped soundtracks for his solo performance-art/dance pieces, that later developed into audio, audio-video, and mixed-media pieces. Language has also been a predominant focus, and John has studied and published haiku poetry, the literary equivalent of the reductive, minimal, and nature-based sound forms that interest him. John’s current work focuses on the rhythms and melodies that exist in our daily aural environments. These sounds usually remain hidden, as we tend to overlook their musical qualities; or, their musical qualities are obscured through mixture with other sounds. This work takes the form of audio CDs, web-based projects, mixed-media installations and performances.

Contracting for companies such as Microsoft, Turner Broadcasting, and Dun & Bradstreet from 1993 to 1998, Klima honed his programming skills while continuing to make art within the flexible schedule that free-lance programming provided. In 1998, Klima discontinued activities as a commercial programmer to focus solely on the creation of art software.

The work is a descendant of the most visually-oriented net.art from the early days: think Redsmoke or Superbad.com. Kalx.com interprets the world wide web as a barrage of abstract images, bright colors vying for attention, and a very meaningless level of pure visual pleasure from the most unlikely of sources. It's an assemblage of vector graphics, map outlines, news photographs, pornography, advertising and video games. The site is the art project- there are no ""pieces,"" just a mosaic dedicated to fulfilling the urge to blindly click and recieve data in response.

Lewis LaCook,"Lorain, OH, USA","Born in Lorain, Ohio on November 5, 1970, he began writing poetry in his early teens, shortly after the death of his father. At sixteen, Black River Review first published his work; subsequently, small press journals like Whiskey Island, the Coventry Reader, andLost and Found Times published LaCook's poetry. While attending Kent State University in the mid-to-late nineties, LaCook developed a passion for music, and played in several bands. Chad Mossholder of the ambient techno duo Twine was an early band mate. During this time LaCook continued to write poetry and publish in the small presses, culminating in 2000 when anabasis press published his long poem Cling as a chapbook. In the late nineties LaCook discovered the internet, and was immediately struck by how easily he might combine his two passions, music and poetry, into a cohesive whole. After the unexpected and tragic death of a close friend in 1999, LaCook barricaded himself in an apartment in Kent, Ohio, and taught himself the rudiments of HTML. It was during this period that LaCook also began collaborating with the poet Sheila Murphy; their long poem, Beyond the Bother of Sunlight, has appeared in excerpts in several small press venues, but has yet to be published in its entirety. As LaCook's use of the internet increased, his focus began to shift from using the medium as a multimedia and distributive tool to exploring it for its own sake. In 2001 he left Kent State University to live with his fiancee Renee Vaverchak in Richmond, Virginia. While there, he began teaching himself basic programming skills, and began using Macromedia's Flash authoring tool to realize his vision of an interactive hypermedia poetry. His early works in this genre met with some success; Rhizome.org began accepting his works into their artBase in 2002, and online venues like CTheory Multimedia, Cauldron and Net, Artifacts at Web Del Sol, 3rd Bed and Slope presented his works on their web sites. LaCook continues to work in a networked medium, reveling in the ability it gives him to create work that allows for the collaboration between the user and the work itself.",http://www.lewislacook.org/,llacook@yahoo.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The New York City-based trio (Kunal Gupta, Tristan Perich, Katie Shima) stage their lush noise constructions with soldering irons on top of overhead projectors, slide projectors, flourescent light towers, and remodeled guitars. Formed in 2005 at Columbia University, the Loud Objects have since skirted between the worlds of noise rock, contemporary music, circuit-bending, and chiptunes, playing at Brooklyn house parties, collaborating with new music ensembles, exhibiting at electronic arts festivals and galleries, and serenading Rhode Island from the trunk of their car. Musically, the Loud Objects explore the sound of electricity, synthesized by microchips and amplified by speakers. Writing their own code to generate sound, they work with audio at the sample level, without utilizing subsequent effects or filters. From silence to a full onslaught of noise, they compositionally weave shifting sonic patterns, often juxtaposed with an accompanying acoustic instrument or yelling audience participation, further exposing electronic sound as a physical medium.",http://www.loudobjects.com/,kg2007@columbia.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nina Sobell,"New York, NY, USA","Nina Sobell is a New York-based artist who has produced a broad body of work embracing various themes, strategies, and mediums, including video, performance, installation, sculpture and live TV.  A participant in the feminist performance movement of the 1970s, her conceptually-based work ranges from taboo performances and museum installations to interactive video matrixes for public participation. Sobell began using video in the '70s as a way to study spectators' interactions with her sculptures, which were placed anonymously in public areas. Exploring video-sculpture, Sobell was intrigued with creating psycho-social transformations via video technology, making environments and mobile structures to physically engage the viewer. Pursuing video’s relation to the subconscious led Sobell to her well-known Brainwave Drawing piece, in which a screen monitor registered the brainwaves of two people and their silent attempt to communicate with each other. Most recently, she has been an AIDS activist, producing the first live viewer-directed AIDS information telecast for TV. She is in the process of creating an interactive AIDS information CD, a virtual brainwave drawing reality, and animating her neo-primitive sculptures via video computer. “Working with time, perception, exploring cognitive theories as art, led me further into the non-static world of video. At this point, I needed to retreat into an intimate personal dialogue, making sculpture for video camera space only, compressing time and private experience.”",http://www.ninasobell.com/,ninasobell@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After his study he became active in the Amsterdam vj-scene. He started fiddling with computers, and made 3D animations in commercial jobs. He also directed video- clips. Unsatisfied with commercial jobs and his role of only doing images and video with music made by others he started to combine video with his own music. In 1995 the character of his work changes dramatically when he discovers the net and the relative easy way interactivity could be achieved by using webpages. After doing some obscure net performances, Luining first got international recognition with his work ""clickclub"", which he presented at the Transmediale festival in Berlin. This netpiece distinguished itself from nearly everthing at that time because of the way the user could and could not interact with its sounds and images. Since 1997 Luining's work is turning towards a kind of minimalism, while maintaining his earlier research of the dynamics of the net. An important milestone in his work is BGO MUI*5 (2002), an interactive public artwork for the Dutch Department of Justice. Inspired by the problems he faced by setting up this large public artwork his work starts to become more conceptual which also means that he starts to theorize and write about the use of computers and it's basic material computersoftware. Peter Luining's work has been widely exhibited internationally. Recent presentations include: Transmediale 2012, Berlin/ Gogbot 2011, Enschede/ STRP festival, Eindhoven, the Netherlands/ Gemak, the Hague, the Netherlands/ Festival de Arte Digital, Belo Horizonte, Brazil/ Art Amsterdam and Mediumturm Graz, Austria.

Pierre Proske,"Melbourne, Australia","Pierre Proske is an Australian electronic artist intrigued by the pervasiveness of technology in culture and its relationship to nature. After years of juggling parallel interests in technology and the arts, Pierre tired of the schizophrenia and finally discovered that it was socially acceptable, in fact highly desirable, to merge the two. Consequently he has taken on the ambitious task of rendering computers accountable to our sometimes misplaced but inevitable humanity. Proske's work involves exposing the unspoken relationships we have with technology and harnessing machines into exploring new aesthetics. He has exhibited or performed in Australia, Sweden., Brazil, Japan and the Netherlands. Having studied Electrical Engineering and Liberal Arts at the University of Melbourne, Australia, Pierre spent 4 years in Sweden where he performed, exhibited and obtained a Master of Science in Art and Technology from Chalmers University.

Plasma Studii,"New York, NY, USA","Judson Wright (judsoN) makes Behavioral Art (BA), art that requires live engagement and is programmed for a playful experience"". The best method for creating these systems is interactivity. The best method for integrating complex interactivity and BA is with formally coded instructions. And by far, the best tool for executing custom code efficiently is the computer. His investigation of BA and ""borrowed intelligence"" has lead to studying the inter-relationship between art (making and experiencing), behavior, and cognition. Cognition is, of course, a broad category, encompassing human, nonhuman and synthetic (computer) development. Regarding behavior, linguistics includes nonverbal communication and music theories. Computer processing is subsequently related to behavior thru Assessment Theory and perception, which brings us around again to evolutionary development.",http://pump.org.in/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk),"Princeton, NJ, USA","The Princeton Laptop Orchestra (PLOrk) is a newly established ensemble of computer-based musical meta-instruments. Each instrument consists of a laptop, a multi-channel hemispherical speaker, and a variety of control devices (keyboards, graphics tablets, sensors, etc…). The students who make up the ensemble act as performers, researchers, composers, and software developers. The challenges are many: what kinds of sounds can they create?; how can they physically control these sounds?; how do they compose with these sounds? There are also social questions with musical and technical ramifications: how do they organize a dozen players in this context? with a conductor? via a wireless network? In its first year of PLOrk’s existence, composers and performers from Princeton and elsewhere developed new pieces for this unprecedented ensemble, including Paul Lansky (Professor of Music at Princeton), Brad Garton (Director of the Columbia Computer Music Center), PLOrk co-founders Dan Trueman and Perry Cook, and several graduate students. They have made extensive use of a new music programming language created by Princeton graduate student (now assistant professor at Stanford University|CCRMA) Ge Wang, called ChucK, which allows the performers to develop new code in performance. In their first major performance (April 2006, Richardson Auditorium) we were joined by the renowned tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain, legendary accordianist and composer Pauline Oliveros, and the exciting young percussion quartet from New York City, So Percussion. PLOrk was featured in the April issues of the MIT Press Technology Review and Wired Magazine, and performed at the Dartmouth College “Orchestras of Sameness” festival in May 2006.",http://plork.cs.princeton.edu/,manyarrowsmusic@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sonya Allin,"Toronto, Canada","Sonya Allin joined IATSL in September of 2007 and has been researching the application of low cost technologies, like web cameras, to balance assessment and training of functional activities, like getting out of a chair or walking down the hall. The training and assessment methodologies she is exploring include some that are largely automated, and which rely heavily on relatively novel computer vision algorithms to parameterize mobility changes as cheaply, independently and robustly as possible. Others, however, explore existing video technologies' ability to cost-effectively shift clinical dialogs about functional mobility from hospitals to the home. Prior to joining IATSL, Sonya completed a Ph.D. at the Human Computer Interaction Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA) where she explored the application of similar, low-cost motion understanding technologies to upper limb assessment after stroke. This research was conducted under the umbrella of the recently founded “Quality of Life” Engineering Consortium joining CMU and the University of Pittsburgh. She has also held diverse positions at non-profit and industrial organizations, including Mitsubishi Engineering Research and gURL.com. In addition to research, Sonya has worked on collaborative artistic efforts (of a generally technological nature) with diverse arts groups including the New York City based ParkBench, and Pittsburgh's TnA. With ParkBench she worked on the Web Séance project, a piece which used bio-statistics to facilitate the formation of, and reveal subtleties in, a group identity; this was exhibited at The Banff Centre in 1999. More recent work, with TnA, explored the use of similarly intimate statistics in a wireless world; this was exhibited during the International Sculpture Conference in 2001.",www.cs.cmu.edu/~sonyaa,sonyaa@cs.cmu.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His commitment to genre-bending and technology-driven innovation in music has produced innumerable collaborations with artists that regularly cross musical and disciplinary boundaries, regularly placing him in venues from clubs to concert halls around the world.

A forerunner in the expansion of the violin beyond its classical and ‘wood-bound’ tradition, Reynolds electrifies in concert, weaves together composed and improvised segments, and makes use of computer technology and digital loops to sculpt his sounds in real time, seamlessly integrating minimalist, pop, Jazz, Indian, African, Celtic and indigenous folk musics into his own sonic blend. As a cross-genre improviser and collaborator, he has appeared and/or recorded with such artists as Anthony Braxton, Uri Caine, John Cale, Steve Coleman, Joe Jackson, Dave Liebman, Yo-Yo Ma, Graham Nash, Greg Osby, Steve Reich, Marcus Roberts and Todd Rundgren, and has commissioned and premiered countless numbers of new works by America’s most compelling composers, including John King, Phil Kline, Michael Gordon, Neil Rolnick, Julia Wolfe, David Lang, Evan Ziporyn and Randall Wolff. His interdisciplinary work includes ongoing collaborations with SoundPainter Walter Thompson as well as media artists Bill Morrison and Luke DuBois and sound artist Jody Elff.

Reynolds is a founder of the band known as Ethel, a critically acclaimed amplified string quartet (represented by ICM Artists), with whom he wrote and toured internationally. He has also produced Still Life With Microphone, an ongoing theater piece which incorporates his own written and improvised music, compositions written for him, and elements of video and theatrical arts.

Troy Innocent,"Adelaide, Australia","Dr Troy Innocent explores the multiplicity of codes in the contemporary mediascape, exploring the connections between language and reality. His work invites people to play in worlds that emerge from transmedia ecologies – complex systems of virtual and actual signs and entities. In his practice he has developed a unique aesthetic vocabulary that spans interaction, design, sculpture, animation, sound and installation. Innocent co-founded the digital arts collective Cyber Dada in 1989 and through pioneering works such as Idea-ON>! (1992) contributed to the Australian new media arts practice during the 90s. His interactive work Iconica (1998) was included in a retrospective at Campbelltown Arts Centre in 2013 as part of ISEA2013 alongside more recent collaborative work. He has exhibited and participated in international festivals, exhibition and symposia including Ars Electronica in 1992 and 2004. Innocent’s more recent public art practice manifests in mixed realities, such as an interactive sculpture garden entitled Colony (2008) in the Melbourne Docklands, Urban Codemakers (2010), an Alternate Reality Game that reinvents the history of Melbourne, and noemaflux, an ongoing work that has appeared on the streets of Ogaki, Instanbul, and Adelaide.

She considers herself a medium, an interface between the living and the dead, the real and the imaginary. Each project aims to connect the present to past so that it might illuminate the future in new ways. Her most recent completed project is The Days of the Commune. She is currently working on a new project called the “The IFIF” (Institute for Incipient Film) about Eisenstein and Brecht in Hollywood and films they might have made. She has been awarded fellowships from Guggenheim Foundation, The Foundation for Contemporary Arts, The Radcliffe Institute at Harvard and the New York Foundation for the Arts.
