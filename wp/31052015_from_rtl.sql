the recommendation of my friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timyoung\">Timothy Young</a> I checked out the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EMXBDMA\"><em>The Martian: A Novel</em> by Andy Weir</a>. Think of it like <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IC8VF10/\">Shackleton&#8217;s Voyage</a> (a great recommendation from <a href=\"http://toni.org/\">Toni</a>) but on Mars. I really enjoyed the book, and if you like geeky, science-filled novels you will too.  One thing about the publishing I thought was really cool, as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(Weir_novel)\">the Wikipedia puts it</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Having been rebuffed by literary agents when trying to get prior books published, Weir decided to put the book online in serial format one chapter at a time for free at his website. At the request of fans he made an Amazon Kindle version available through Amazon.com at 99 cents (the minimum he could set the price).

We <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/cloudup-makes-file-sharing-incredibly-easy\">discussed the concept</a> in early 2014 and readers were concerned about owning their data.</p>\n<p>Two years later, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/04/smith/\">WordPress media library and the visual post editor</a> have received major improvements while integration with Cloudup is non-existent. When Matt Mullenweg was asked about the integration in a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-194-celebrating-wordpress-12th-birthday-with-matt-mullenweg\">recent interview</a>, he responded,</p>\n<blockquote><p>We did a lot of really awesome UI improvements to the editor and did some things we were very excited about, but because we weren&#8217;t working on a TinyMCE base, some of the basic editing stuff was really difficult.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The team spent about six months to complete the first 80% of the project then spent a year and a half to reach 85%. Setbacks included a lot of rabbit holes and hidden complexity. The team now works on different things within Automattic that revolve around data.</p>\n<h2>Zeditor is an Educational Resource</h2>\n<p>The work completed by the team is <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/zeditor\">open source and available on GitHub</a>. It&#8217;s called Zeditor and serves as an educational resource. &#8220;We learned a ton through the way we architected the JavaScript and we think it serves as a good model for doing lots of JavaScript projects going forward,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Listen to Mullenweg explain why Cloudup is not replacing the WordPress media library in the following audio clip.

When asked about the project in a recent interview, Matt Mullenweg explained that despite loving the project and truly believing in it, work on o2 has shifted to other parts of WordPress.com to focus on the service&#8217;s core products.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Saying no is one of the hardest things but I think that&#8217;s where great design comes from is when you say no to a thousand things, including the things you love, or you really wanted to do. Saying no to the lame stuff is easy, but saying no to something you really believe in like o2 is much harder but that focus is crucial for creating great products.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Although Mullenweg says anyone on WordPress.com can enable o2, this is not the case. Searching for o2 on WordPress.com generates no results while P2 brings up the original P2 theme.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/o2ThemeNotFound.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44513\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/o2ThemeNotFound.png?resize=921%2C312\" alt=\"o2 Theme Not Found\" /></a>o2 Theme Not Found\n<p>o2 is used internally at Automattic and the code is available via <a href=\"https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe/\">WordPress.com&#8217;s subversion repository</a>. o2 is not listed since it was supposed to be a plugin but the work inside of o2 is listed under P2 Breathe.

Founders <a href=\"http://muneebali.com\" target=\"_blank\">Muneeb Ali</a> and <a href=\"http://shea.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Ryan Shea</a> are pioneering decentralized identity with the long-term goal of creating decentralized authentication.</p>\n<p>Earlier this month, BNS debuted <a href=\"https://passcard.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Passcard</a>, a digital form of identity and access control combined. It&#8217;s essentially a digital passport, secured by the blockchain, that allows you to control and display your identity.</p>\n<p>A few months ago,  <a href=\"https://www.larrysalibra.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Larry Salibra</a>, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.pay4bugs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pay4Bugs</a>, released a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-adds-openname-avatars-to-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">plugin that adds Openname avatars to WordPress</a>. An ardent fan of blockchain technology, Salibra has just released another plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nametiles/\" target=\"_blank\">Nametiles</a> that adds Passcard profiles and tagging to WordPress.</p>\n<p>Nametiles works like this: Type the plus character and a person&#8217;s +passname on a post or page and it will automatically display that person&#8217;s Passcard profile information when you hover over the link.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nametiles-example.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/nametiles-example.jpg?resize=920%2C739\" alt=\"nametiles-example\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44449\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin also includes the ability for registered users on your site to optionally use their Passcard avatar via a setting in wp-admin/profile.php.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://nametiles.co/\" target=\"_blank\">Nametiles</a> site has a live demo of how the tiles appear on your website. You can also see Nametiles in action on the <a href=\"https://www.bitcoinhk.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bitcoin Association of Hong Kong’s website</a>, where it&#8217;s in use on the <a href=\"https://www.bitcoinhk.org/members/\" target=\"_blank\">members</a> page and <a href=\"https://www.bitcoinhk.org/2015-inside-bitcoins-discount/\" target=\"_blank\">posts</a>.</p>\n<p>Salibra created Nametiles to help publishers keep people&#8217;s information and links continually up-to-date. Its two primary benefits for publishers include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Profile information is never stale and always up-to-date (including website, bio, social links, avatar, etc)</li>\n<li>Users control their information and personal brand via Passcard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Publishers have no idea when the people mentioned or linked on their blog update their profile pic, bio, or website and no practical way to find out,&#8221; Salibra said. &#8220;The result is a site littered with broken links and out of date information that conveys sloppiness and apathy to visitors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This plugin is especially useful for sites that often have guest post authors, as well as news and organization sites that frequently reference names in content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With Nametiles, profile information about those you mention on your site is always up to date because the information is maintained by those who care most, the owners of the information,&#8221; Salibra said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited for a future where digital identity is something we own instead of something big social companies use to pull visitors from our blogs and websites and track people,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The only catch is that users who are linked have to be registered for a <a href=\"https://passcard.info/\" target=\"_blank\">Passcard</a> profile. The blockchain-powered identity service is free but it is also so new that it hasn&#8217;t yet caught on.</p>\n<p>The idea of Passcard is similar to <a href=\"https://en.gravatar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gravatar</a> but has the potential to be more powerful, as it is secured by the blockchain and may eventually support decentralized authentication. If Passcard founders are successful in building the future of identification, it may be a long before the identity system is mainstream enough for the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nametiles/\" target=\"_blank\">Nametiles</a> plugin to be useful beyond certain niche websites.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 May 2015 00:35:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"Matt: Money and Motivation\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45104\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/money-and-motivation/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:210:\"<p><a href=\"http://intenseminimalism.com/2012/the-misconception-about-money-and-motivation/\">The Misconception about Money and Motivation</a>, a good summary of the work by Dan Pink, Dan Ariely, and others.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 29 May 2015 00:23:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Sucuri is Building a Comprehensive Alternative to CloudFlare\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44415\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"http://wptavern.com/sucuri-is-building-a-comprehensive-alternative-to-cloudflare\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4812:\"<p><a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Sucuri</a> launched a new free performance tool today.

Like most things we do, the performance tool was a tool to satisfy our own needs.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Sucuri Is Expanding to Accommodate Plans for a Full-Featured CloudFlare Alternative</h3>\n<p>Sucuri is currently managing over 40 billion page views per month via its WAF network. The team is working on expanding to a full WAF/CDN solution to serve performance-related features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The fundamental difference is that it&#8217;s security first, performance second,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;So yes, in the coming months you&#8217;ll see more as our solution blossoms into a full WAF/CDN solution.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Up until now the company has been limited by using a leased architecture but is making changes to support the WAF/CDN expansion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re actively migrating from a leased architecture to our own infrastructure, giving us full control of the website,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;This gives us optimal control to mitigate all attacks, including large scale DDOS attacks; a by-product of that will be performance in the form of a global CDN.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sucuri is is building its own DNS architecture with full DNS management within its application.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Users will have an alternative to solutions like <a href=\"https://www.cloudflare.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CloudFlare</a>,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;The fundamental difference being we&#8217;re a security company first.</p>\n<p>Sucuri is building its expansion on top of the an <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anycast\" target=\"_blank\">Anycast</a> network, which means that users&#8217; requests will be routed to the nearest node on request.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With most of the content cached at the edge it&#8217;ll be designed for optimal speeds regardless of where you are in the world,&#8221; Perez said. &#8220;That&#8217;s perhaps the biggest feature &#8211; most everything comes down to our design and configuration and how we handle the traffic.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked if he sees the final WAF/CDN solution to be a comprehensive Cloudflare alternative, Perez responded, &#8220;Oh hell yeah &#8211; with one key differentiator: we&#8217;ll clean the mess too.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea is when you think of Sucuri it&#8217;s a complete package &#8211; Protection &#8211; Detection &#8211; Response. It&#8217;s all built in-house, no third-party integrations,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cleaning is the one thing that no one else can match us on, it&#8217;s either too much liability or they haven&#8217;t figured out how to scale.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Sucuri&#8217;s WAF service is currently used by iThemes, Gravity Forms, List25, and many others in the WordPress space. If the company is able to deliver on their CloudFlare alternative, which is planned for this summer, customers will have the opportunity to get their security services bundled in with the new performance-enhancing features of the CDN.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 28 May 2015 19:23:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"WPTavern: Fast Page Switch Adds a Quick Way to Switch Between Pages in the WordPress Backend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44405\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"http://wptavern.com/fast-page-switch-adds-a-quick-way-to-switch-between-pages-in-the-wordpress-backend\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1232:\"<p>If you find yourself editing pages often and want a quick way to switch between them without visiting the All Pages screen first, try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/fast-page-switch/\">Fast Page Switch</a> plugin by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marclarr/\">Marc Wiest</a>.</p>\n<p>Fast Page Switch adds a metabox with a drop down menu to the Page editing screen that allows you to quickly switch to a different page.

The hotly debated topic concerns what is permissible in terms of &#8220;content creation&#8221; for themes that are hosted in the official directory.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We know that CPTs and custom taxonomies are off-limits; likewise with non-presentational post custom meta data,&#8221; Bennett said. &#8220;But what about content created via theme options, custom widgets, etc.?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This question often comes up in relation to themes that offer static front pages with custom widgets or textareas in the customizer where users can add small blocks of text. For example, a theme might offer a biography section or a place to enter copyright text. The concern is that a user is entering content, not knowing that it will be lost upon switching themes.</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team has had an <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1432668662001049\" target=\"_blank\">established policy for years</a> that forbids theme authors from defining the generation of user content. However, due to disorganization during the process of moving the official version of theme requirements from the Codex to the Theme Review Handbook, this particular guideline was omitted.</p>\n<p>Bennett posted a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/05/27/theme-review-requirements-and-documentation/\" target=\"_blank\">review of Theme Review Requirements and documentation</a> today on the Make/Themes blog with previously omitted items highlighted in red for clarity.</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Presentation vs. Functionality</strong><br />\nSince the purpose of Themes is to define the presentation of user content, Themes must not be used to define the generation of user content, or to define Theme-independent site options or functionality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As this is a fairly general statement, the Theme Review Team will be discussing the finer points of how it applies during the next meeting. In the past, this guideline has been subjectively and inconsistently applied, allowing many themes to slip by with functionality that falls into these grey areas.</p>\n<h2>Theme Review Team to Begin Aggressively Enforcing &#8220;No Content Creation&#8221; Guideline</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/zerif-lite/\" target=\"_blank\">Zerif Lite</a>, one of the top themes on WordPress.org, was highlighted during the meeting as an example of a theme that has been permitted to skirt this guideline, among others.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Looking at Zerif Lite: testimonials, our team, our focus, about us &#8211; these are all CPTs, disguised as custom widgets,&#8221; Bennett said. In a <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24907\" target=\"_blank\">ticket where the theme is currently being reviewed for updates</a>, Bennett encouraged Zerif Lite&#8217;s author to remove any custom post meta data, except for that that which is presenatational, as it falls into plugin territory. This includes aspects of the theme such as author details, team member position, social network profiles, etc.</p>\n<p>Reviewers are already aggressively cracking down on Zerif Lite&#8217;s violation of this specific guideline and will likely extend their vigilance to uphold the guideline more consistently with all themes as they come up for review.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.codeinwp.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Codeinwp</a>, the company behind Zerif Lite, replied to Bennetts&#8217; requests on the ticket:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most of the things that you are pointing out are really sensitive for two reasons: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Probably 50% of the most popular themes use some custom content on the homepage</li>\n<li>A lot of things like contact issue or testimonial can&#8217;t be solved without breaking 100k sites which use the theme</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Codeinwp contends that the approach used in Zerif Lite is far more user friendly than having to install a plugin, or multiple plugins, in order to add small bits of text to the home page.</p>\n<blockquote><p>At the end I agree that our approach was a bit different/radical. However, it looks like it is something that people really want (Zerif is one of the hottest themes at the moment, with mentions all over the web). I mean most of them want to build a beautiful site in 10 minutes, without any knowledge and with Zerif Lite they can easily do it. They don&#8217;t want 10 CPT, 10 required plugins, contact form, and Captcha plugins for a simple site.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The theme author believes that creating a plugin to handle four of the theme&#8217;s focus widgets would simply waste users&#8217; time.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, you realize the amount of work required to do this for 100+ themes installed on million of sites, right?&#8221; Codeinwp said. The author also cited several other examples of popular themes in violation, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/accesspress-parallax/\" target=\"_blank\">AccessPress Parallax</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/onetone/\" target=\"_blank\">Onetone</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/colorway\" target=\"_blank\">Colorway</a>.</p>\n<p>Given that the WordPress.org theme directory is riddled with violations of what is purported to be a long standing guideline, it&#8217;s clear that reviewers have been exceedingly lax in enforcing it. Theme authors who were ignorant of this guideline will be in for a rude awakening on their next submission for an update. Bennett <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24907\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> in the ticket open on Zerif Lite that the policy will be strongly enforced in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It has recently come to our attention that possibly several themes have been approved that may have similar issues. We&#8217;ll address them as we find them, and work with the developers to come up with a plan to bring the themes back into conformance with the requirements &#8211; just as we&#8217;ll do here with your theme.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This will mean a considerable amount of work for authors who have defined ways for users to generate content through the theme. They will need to port this functionality into a plugin(s).</p>\n<p>WordPress.org themes are not permitted to bundle plugins, but authors can recommend plugins using the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/tgm-plugin-activation-library-publishes-roadmap-for-version-3-0\" target=\"_blank\">TGM Plugin Activation Library</a> or another method. Themes are only permitted to recommend plugins that are listed in the official WordPress.org plugin directory. This means that authors who remove functionality in favor of companion plugins will need to get those plugins approved for WordPress.org before submitting their themes for updates.</p>\n<p>Next week&#8217;s Theme Review Team meeting will include a discussion on specific examples of types of content that themes should or should not be allowed to create, i.e. button text, copyright text, etc. The team is generally in favor of authors using core methods for content creation.</p>\n<p>Documentation regarding this issue has been unclear, incomplete, and scattered, spread across the Codex, Make/Themes, and two different places in the Theme Handbook. The team is working to rectify this in light of its renewed dedication to systematically enforce the &#8220;no content creation&#8221; guideline.</p>\n<p>This will affect many of the top themes hosted on WordPress.org, which will be forced to implement changes that are likely to break thousands of sites&#8217; appearance on update. <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/do-wordpress-org-themes-need-a-changelog\" target=\"_blank\">Without a change log</a> in place, many users will not be aware when they are receiving an update that suddenly requires the installation of new plugins.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 May 2015 21:31:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Matt: Why Awe?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45102\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/why-awe/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:436:\"<blockquote><p>In the great balancing act of our social lives, between the gratification of self-interest and a concern for others, fleeting experiences of awe redefine the self in terms of the collective, and orient our actions toward the needs of those around us.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The New York Times answers <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/24/opinion/sunday/why-do-we-experience-awe.html\">Why Do We Experience Awe?</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 May 2015 16:48:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: My Struggle to Learn How the WordPress REST API Works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44319\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"http://wptavern.com/my-struggle-to-learn-how-the-wordpress-rest-api-works\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3087:\"<p>Earlier today, I watched a <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/learn-how-to-utilize-the-wp-rest-api-with-rachel-baker\">free presentation</a> on how to use the WordPress REST API by Rachael Baker via <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com\">WPSessions</a>. If you missed it, you can <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com/sessions/utilizing-the-wp-rest-api/\">watch the recording</a> for $9.</p>\n<p>As I watched the presentation, it was clear that no matter how many tutorials I read, WordCamp sessions I attend, and videos I watch, I won&#8217;t be able to grasp the API until I use products built with it. I&#8217;m not a developer and the REST API is developer centric technology.</p>\n<h2>What I Think the REST API Is</h2>\n<p>Based on what I&#8217;ve learned so far, I&#8217;ve figured out that the API provides a series of end points which are specific parts of WordPress. These end points can be connected to and manipulated through the REST API.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s this API that opens up a slew of new opportunities for application developers to send and receive data. This is what allows a developer to build an app that connects to WordPress with minimal code.</p>\n<h2>Learning Custom Post Types</h2>\n<p>In 2010, there <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/styling-individual-pagesposts\">were a lot of requests</a> for <a href=\"http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/wordpress-2-8-and-the-body_class-function/\">tutorials</a> on how to give specific posts a unique style. When <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types\">Custom Post Types</a> were introduced in WordPress 3.0, I was excited because I thought they would provide the ability to create custom styles for posts.</p>\n<p>Looking back, some of the requests are due to the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Migrating_Plugins_and_Themes_to_2.7#Post_Classes\">post_class() function</a> added in WordPress 2.7 that provides the ability to use CSS to style a post. It took a few years to rewire my brain to not think of Custom Post Types this way.</p>\n<p>When I described how long it took to figure out Custom Post Types on Twitter, Justin Tadlock responded, that end users should have never been introduced to the term <em>post type</em>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0\">@jeffr0</a> End users should\'ve never heard the term \"post type\". We devs did a poor job with that.

Unfortunately, not all users have the motivation to follow through with adding a profile picture. You could use a plugin to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/add-avatar-upload-to-buddypress-registration\" target=\"_blank\">add avatar upload to registration</a>, or even <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-forces-buddypress-users-to-upload-a-profile-photo\" target=\"_blank\">force BuddyPress users to upload a profile photo</a> before accessing other pages. However, this may seem a bit heavy handed for some social networks.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-identicons/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Identicons</a> plugin is one alternative that will bring some color to the members directory without troubling users to upload a profile photo. By default, those who haven&#8217;t uploaded an image will have the mystery man avatar assigned. Too many of these can turn your directories into a sea of grey and white and give the impression that members are not invested in the community. BuddyPress Identicons replaces the mystery man with GitHub-style identicons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/buddypress-identicons.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/buddypress-identicons.jpg?resize=644%2C404\" alt=\"buddypress-identicons\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44322\" /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress developer <a href=\"http://henrywright.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Henry Wright</a>, the plugin&#8217;s creator, was inspired by <a href=\"https://github.com/blog/1586-identicons\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub&#8217;s implementation of identicons</a>, which the social network added in 2013 for users who do not have a Gravatar. The idea is based on <a href=\"https://github.com/donpark/identicon\" target=\"_blank\">Don Park&#8217;s original Java and Canvas implementations</a> for creating unique identicons.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/henry-identicon.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/henry-identicon.jpg?resize=229%2C163\" alt=\"henry-identicon\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-44338\" /></a>BuddyPress Identicons are uniquely generated from a hash of the member&#8217;s username. The implementation will not look exactly how it does on GitHub, as the logic used to generate the identicon is somewhat different. In fact, this plugin allows for a few customizations to better fit your social network. You can set the background to transparent in the BuddyPress settings menu and also adjust the image size by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-identicons/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">defining the constants in your bp-custom.php file</a>.</p>\n<p>The plugin is compatible with both WordPress multisite and bbPress. After testing it on a BuddyPress site, I can confirm that it works as advertised. If you&#8217;ve been frustrated by a lack of unique avatars on your social network, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-identicons/\" target=\"_blank\">BuddyPress Identicons</a> plugin provides an instant fix. Simply install it from WordPress.org, activate it, and all of your mystery men will be transformed into unique, colorful identicons.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 26 May 2015 23:04:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: Postcard Project Discontinued, iOS and Android Apps Now Open Source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44282\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"http://wptavern.com/postcard-project-discontinued-ios-and-android-apps-now-open-source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6094:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/postcard-share.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/postcard-share.jpg?resize=316%2C531\" alt=\"postcard-share\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-44291\" /></a>Kyle Newsome, creator of <a href=\"http://www.postcardsocial.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Postcard</a>, announced over the weekend that the project will be discontinued. The free social sharing app for iOS <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/own-your-content-postcard-social-sharing-app-launches-with-wordpress-integration\" target=\"_blank\">launched in February of 2014</a> with the aim to make it easy to share content from your phone to multiple social networks, including your own website.</p>\n<p>Postcard&#8217;s chief selling point was the idea of owning your own content. Instead of posting content directly on Facebook or Twitter, for example, you could set your own website as the “host” network and direct all the traffic there.</p>\n<p>Newsome also built a free WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postcard-social/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> as a companion to the app to allow users to host and archive their data. He intended it to help users make sure their websites didn&#8217;t go stale as they regularly posted short form content to social networks.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the idea did not catch on as Newsome hoped it would and he was unable to keep up with the maintenance.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve fallen behind on maintenance and, due to some sweeping new policy changes in Facebook&#8217;s platform as of May 2015, the live iOS and Android development versions are broken and it&#8217;s been the final kick in my ass necessary to admit Postcard is unsustainable,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Despite making progress on the Android version last month, he was ultimately unable to get it ready for release on the Android market.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Android version making progress. It is very real. <a href=\"http://t.co/7nYYtnHZpm\">pic.twitter.com/7nYYtnHZpm</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Postcard (@postcardsocial) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/postcardsocial/status/458338905772023808\">April 21, 2014</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://postcardsocial.net/posts/2015-05-25-post-mortem\" target=\"_blank\">Postcard&#8217;s post mortem</a>, Newsome identified changes to external services and their APIs as one of the primary factors for discontinuing the project.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Postcard was an interesting project for me. It started from a frustration with ever changing policies and lack of standardization in social media and ironically will be shutting down for exactly the same reasons. I really have to say that social media management is a tough thing to tackle for any single developer. It&#8217;s hard enough to depend on code that you didn&#8217;t write yourself and it&#8217;s even harder to depend multiple on APIs. It takes a lot of maintenance just to stand still.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Keeping the WordPress plugin updated was also a challenge, and Newsome was discouraged at the prospect of having to rebuild it in the near future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress plugin also got stale as a major update and even a new forthcoming JSON API made the custom work I had done seem like a large investment made in something soon to be obsolete,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, he found that the costs of maintaining the app, both financially and in terms of time spent, were unsustainable, as the app only pulled in a total of $750 over the past year. This barely covered the app store licensing fees.</p>\n<h3>Postcard Mobile Apps Now Open Source</h3>\n<p>Newsome has no intention of maintaining or developing the mobile apps or the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postcard-social/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress plugin</a> anymore. The apps are now available on GitHub under the MIT license with broken/partial functionality:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>iOS:</strong> <a href=\"http://github.com/bitwit/postcard-ios\" target=\"_blank\">github.com/bitwit/postcard-ios</a></li>\n<li><strong>Android:</strong> <a href=\"http://github.com/bitwit/postcard-android\" target=\"_blank\">github.com/bitwit/postcard-android</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the code is available to any developer who wants to take the original Postcard idea and run with it or modify it to suit another purpose.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be that developer who never admits their project is over when it&#8217;s over,&#8221; Newsome said. &#8220;Both myself and my users deserve better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He hoped that Postcard would fundamentally change how people use social networks, but the idea of having your WordPress site as the host network for your social content never really caught on. Since many people do not host and maintain their own websites, the golden feature of this app probably went unused by the majority of those who tried it. The ability to broadcast the same content to multiple networks was likely the more popular feature. In the end, the Postcard iOS app was downloaded just 6,000 times.</p>\n<p>Postcard&#8217;s failure may be an indication that people are still not ready for decentralized social networking, where you host your own data and distribute it to third-party social networks at will. Given that the project was powered by a one-person team (a developer who is otherwise employed), Postcard had little chance of being able to keep pace with the development burden of external networks and their changing APIs.</p>\n<p>Newsome may not have launched it with enough resources, or it may not have been the right approach or the right time. Multiple factors combined ultimately spelled Postcard&#8217;s doom, but if any interested parties have the vision and time to revive it or fork it, Newsome is happy to assist in any small way.

Cover brings blogging minimalism to a new level. After less than a month on WordPress.org, it has already been downloaded more than 2,500 times.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cover.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cover.png?resize=880%2C660\" alt=\"cover\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44244\" /></a></p>\n<p>Cover was created by new WordPress.org theme author <a href=\"http://eichefam.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Paul Eiche</a> and is based on the popular <a href=\"http://underscores.me/\" target=\"_blank\">Underscores starter theme</a> maintained by Automattic.</p>\n<p>The theme&#8217;s simple, single-column design is accented by support for full-width featured images. It was bundled with <a href=\"http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Awesome</a> to allow users to easily add scalable vector icons to any content or social menu. Cover incorporates the lightweight <a href=\"https://github.com/WickyNilliams/headroom.js\" target=\"_blank\">Headroom.js</a> script for hiding your header until it&#8217;s needed. It also includes <a href=\"https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr\" target=\"_blank\">skrollr.js</a>, a stand-alone parallax scrolling library for mobile (Android + iOS) and desktop.</p>\n<p>Cover&#8217;s widgets and menus are optional and hidden behind an full-screen overlay triggered by the hamburger icon. This keeps the focus on your content while offering plenty of space for unlimited widgets in the overlay.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cover-overlay.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cover-overlay.jpg?resize=965%2C669\" alt=\"Cover\'s overlay for widgets and menus\" class=\"size-full wp-image-44265\" /></a>Cover&#8217;s overlay for widgets and menus\n<p>Cover supports one regular navigation menu, one for social media, and an additional social menu in the footer. If you&#8217;re using Jetpack’s Infinite Scrolling module, the theme will actually detect whether or not the footer social menu is present and respond accordingly.</p>\n<p>The theme was built to make a nice accompaniment to sites using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/aesop-story-engine/\" target=\"_blank\">Aesop Story Engine</a> plugin, although it&#8217;s not required. When used with the plugin, content can expand to full-width when using components such as images, galleries, maps, etc.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a developer wanting to modify the theme, you&#8217;ll find that Cover&#8217;s stylesheet is compressed. It was built with Sass and the /sass directory includes all the necessary components for compiling the stylesheet.</p>\n<p>Cover is a beautifully responsive theme that presents your website in a bold way on any device. Its minimalist design supports your content instead of upstaging it with the clutter of widgets and navigation. Check out a <a href=\"http://eichefam.net/projects/cover/\" target=\"_blank\">live demo</a> on the theme&#8217;s project page to see it in action. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/cover/\" target=\"_blank\">Cover</a> is available for free on WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 22 May 2015 23:15:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"WPTavern: Hello Security Plugin Aims to Educate WordPress Users on Web Security Best Practices\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44205\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:104:\"http://wptavern.com/hello-security-plugin-aims-to-educate-wordpress-users-on-web-security-best-practices\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4532:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-security/\">Hello Security</a> is a new plugin developed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/m_butcher/\">Michele Butcher</a> that displays security tips and reminders in the WordPress backend.

A full list of the tips used is located <a href=\"https://github.com/mlbanddrb/hello-security/blob/master/hello-security.php\">within the hello-security.php file</a>.</p>\n<h2>Inspiration, Motivation, and Determination</h2>\n<p>For years, Butcher has avoided learning how to code. Thanks to a WordCamp session and inspirational members of the WordPress community, she now has a plugin of her own. In this short interview, we find out what held her back from developing plugins sooner and who inspired her to go through the process.</p>\n<p><strong>What held you back from writing your first plugin?</strong></p>\n<p>For the longest time, I didn&#8217;t want to learn how to code. I was a firm believer in that there&#8217;s a plugin for everything. Once I was motivated enough to create one, I didn&#8217;t know what to create first.</p>\n<p>I have ideas for the types of plugins I want to make but I always find three plugins with similar functionality. The first WordPress plugin I&#8217;ve ever looked at the code for is Better WP Security, developed by <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chriswiegman/\">Chris Wiegman</a> that eventually turned into iThemes Security.</p>\n<p>I knew I would have to dig deep into learning code before I could write a plugin that large. I discovered the best way to learn code is to jump in and read actively developed code. Once I became comfortable reading code, I started to get ideas on plugins to create.</p>\n<p><strong>What motivated you enough to go through with creating and releasing your first plugin?</strong></p>\n<p>I subconsciously kept telling myself to <em>just make something</em>. I eventually decided to get into plugin development and taking the first step was the hardest. I bounced ideas off of friends for a long time before I jumped in and just made one.</p>\n<p>At WordCamp North Canton, I attended <a href=\"https://northcanton.wordcamp.org/2015/session/introduction-to-plugin-development/\">Topher DeRosia&#8217;s session, </a>Introduction to WordPress Plugin Development. After the session was over, I realized I didn&#8217;t have to make something that has thousands of lines of code. I brainstormed ideas, thinking how I could use Hello Dolly.</p>\n<p><strong>What inspired you to write Hello Security?</strong></p>\n<p>The first idea that came to mind in using Hello Dolly was not security related. I initially thought of doing something fun like Hello Jovi (Bon Jovi lyrics) or Hello Marvel where I use awesome one liners from the various Marvel movies. Iron Man quotes alone would have given me at least 30 lines to work with.</p>\n<p>I decided against doing something fun and make something that could be useful. Many of the quotes in Hello Security are things I say at all of my talks, tell every client after I clean their site, and mention to everyone who is getting into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Hello Security is there to help those who are either new to WordPress or might not know how or why they should keep their site secure. It is a way to be proactive before something bad happens.

The resource includes each company&#8217;s business model, description, and monthly/yearly revenue.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordpress-business-revenue.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordpress-business-revenue.png?resize=1025%2C921\" alt=\"wordpress-business-revenue\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44219\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bolinger is planning to use this information in an upcoming presentation and will be keeping the resource up to date with new submissions and figures as they roll in.</p>\n<p>Transparency reports from WordPress businesses, ranging from small to large, have been popping up frequently over the past year, as owners are surprisingly eager to share their progress and receive feedback from the community. These kinds of reports are not unique to the WordPress ecosystem, but they do seem to complement the spirit of adventure that is common among open source product developers.</p>\n<p>Zack Katz, co-founder of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/gravityview-is-now-public-on-github\" target=\"_blank\">GravityView</a>, remarked on his motivation to share the company&#8217;s revenue publicly.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think sharing revenue humanizes GravityView: we&#8217;re not a nameless corporation where you put in money and somehow good products and customer service come out,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our customers are part of an interaction: their purchase of a support license directly allows us to develop the product and help them do great things with their websites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Katz hopes that the resource will be inspirational for WordPress entrepreneurs who are just getting started.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The WordPress community is slowly realizing that businesses don&#8217;t have to be cutthroat black boxes to succeed. As more people and businesses share and open up, we&#8217;re redefining what it means to be a business in the WordPress ecosystem. I think this leads to lower barriers to entry for others to participate. By sharing GravityView&#8217;s numbers and some of the things I&#8217;ve learned, I hope others are better informed and inspired to join our community.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Nick Haskins, founder of Aesop Interactive, is currently in the midst of <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/lasso-frontend-editing-plugin-for-wordpress-now-available-on-github\" target=\"_blank\"> active experimentation with his products and business model</a> and recently published a <a href=\"http://aesopinteractive.com/jan-april-2015-report/\" target=\"_blank\">transparency report</a> for his 15-month old company. He believes that these kinds of reports are important for demonstrating the types of products and pricing models that can be successful.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think for Aesopinteractive it&#8217;s showing that you can still abide by WordPress theme best practices, and be successful at selling WordPress themes as add-ons at $129 each with 3-5 options and no functionality,&#8221; Haskins said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Plus, I really hope it motivates other &#8216;small timers&#8217; to share numbers as well, and be held accountable for our growth. It&#8217;s a lot like sharing your goals publicly, and letting people hold you accountable for it.

He initially wrote the parser/indexer for his own use, to improve efficiency in his work, and was inspired to make it a public resource.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have been professionally working with WordPress since 2.8, but most of which I would describe as &#8216;superficial development,\'&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t until later, roughly WordPress 3.5, that a large-scale WordPress project came along.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I found myself spending an obscene amount of time either digging through code within my IDE, or performing countless Google searches, in order to uncover/understand various hooks, functions, constants etc. So, I wrote a plugin that would index the application/site it was installed within&#8211; this was the first iteration of Hookr.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a developer whose career is not based in the WordPress ecosystem, Sanford didn&#8217;t know what to expect when he tested the waters with his new public resource for developers. After several months in alpha, the traffic and feedback were enough to convince him to invest in performance improvements and an overhaul of the UI.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The alpha version of the site was truly alpha &#8211; the UI was a complete afterthought, there were many UI bugs/hiccups, the navigation was not cohesive; it was a hot mess,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;Prior to the beta, I had not updated hookr.io for months, which was purposeful. I wanted to see if the traffic would completely level-off, or if it would remain consistent, with the latter being the determining factor as to whether or not I would continue with the project.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Hookr Beta Adds UI/UX Improvements and Support for 800+ Plugins and Themes</h2>\n<p>Sanford was surprised and encouraged to find that usage of the site was solid and continued to grow. He spent the next three months fixing issues, rewriting core parts of the parser, and refining the UI to focus on features that people actually needed. The site has now entered beta with a slew of noteworthy improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>UI/UX overhaul, with emphasis on responsiveness and fewest number of clicks</li>\n<li>Hookr.io is now twice as fast with half the download payload (mobile first)</li>\n<li>Themes have been introduced to the index &#8211; (current count: 62)</li>\n<li>Hundreds of plugins added to the index (current count: 827)</li>\n<li>5 of the latest versions of each plugin and theme (previously included a single version for each plugin)</li>\n<li>Usage examples that users can cut and paste</li>\n<li>Annotated source code</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://hookr.io/all/#index=a\" target=\"_blank\">Index screens</a> are infinitely-scrollable and filterable, which cuts down on a lot of clicking through endless pagination. <a href=\"http://hookr.io/4.1.1/filters/get_search_form/\" target=\"_blank\">Hook details</a> have been refined to follow a format similar to PHP&#8217;s detail pages and include annotated code signatures and descriptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hookr-annotated-descriptions.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hookr-annotated-descriptions.png?resize=1025%2C701\" alt=\"hookr-annotated-descriptions\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44177\" /></a></p>\n<p>In addition to the basic info about the file and lines where the code/object is defined, Hookr has also been updated to display any related hook callbacks sharing the same tag name or signature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hookr-relations.png\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/hookr-relations.png?resize=1025%2C701\" alt=\"hookr-relations\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44179\" /></a></p>\n<p>Usage examples for every action, filter, function, and constant can now be easily copied. Users can also quickly view source code with Hookr&#8217;s new hyperlinked and annotated source code blocks.</p>\n<h2>To Rebrand or Not to Rebrand?</h2>\n<p>Many of those in search of a comprehensive hook/API reference find Hookr to be easier to use than the official <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org code reference</a>. Sanford has experienced friction from creating what some perceive to be a competing resource.</p>\n<blockquote><p>There were several people that have/had an issue with the resource even existing. For the sake of full-disclosure, my career is outside the WordPress ecosystem; it is simply a platform I use (and love), not a lifestyle. </p>\n<p>My experience with the &#8216;community&#8217; has been mostly positive; many people love the resource, while others are indifferent. I wrote Hookr to aid legit designers/developers/agencies, not hobbyists masquerading as designers/developers who have no skill besides martyrdom and nothing positive to contribute.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Hookr name has also proven to be controversial, as a few vocal opponents find it to be off-putting and offensive. Sanford said that he is very much torn over rebranding the site but is open to the idea.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The WordPress market is saturated &#8211; it is hard to make any sort of impact, hence the name,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The name is short, controversial, relevant, and memorable &#8211; either people love or hate it, of course. It was never the intent to insult, offend, or alienate any demographic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If people are uncomfortable saying &#8220;Hookr&#8221; in an open forum, then maybe it&#8217;s time to put my personal ethos aside for the betterment of the resource. That being said, I am on the fence in regards to renaming/rebranding Hookr. If I do, it&#8217;s only to remove the initial barrier/stigma and promote usage.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As the site is still in beta, Sanford is still collecting feedback from users but is concentrating on features, fixes, and SEO. If he decides to rebrand, it will likely happen as the site moves out of beta.</p>\n<h2>The Future of the Hookr.io Resource</h2>\n<p>After streamlining the design, removing a few features that no one used, and refining those that worked, Sanford reports that so far users are enjoying the beta version of Hookr.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The feedback I have received has been exceedingly positive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The usage has effectively doubled.&#8221; User suggestions regarding the search functionality are shaping the roadmap for the next iteration of the resource.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The current search implementation is more or less a filter mechanism, which is effective once you&#8217;ve drilled-down to the relevant index,&#8221; Sanford said. &#8220;However, numerous users have asked for a traditional &#8216;global&#8217; keyword search that spans core, plugins, and themes. The global search, along with a few other features, will be released within the next month or so.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Sanford is committed to keeping the resource free for anyone to use, he is exploring a few long term options for monetization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Cluttering the interface with ads is not something I want to do, but never say never,&#8221; he said. &#8220;However, there is another opportunity for monetization.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the future, Sanford is looking at the possibility of establishing the infrastructure to offer Hookr (SaaS) for commercial theme and plugin developers.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When I released Hookr Alpha, a few people inquired about using it to augment the documentation of their premium plugin/theme. I wasn&#8217;t confident that it was a true &#8216;value-add.&#8217; Over the course of a year, I&#8217;ve refined the parser and data objects to a point of viability. </p>\n<p>The Hookr Parser analyzes source code, which is then reconciled against the inline documentation describing it; often times, the inline documentation is either missing or is erroneous. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheJeffMatson\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Matson</a> and I discussed these issues and decided that Hookr would be invaluable if it could identify these issues, which it now does.</p></blockquote>\n<p>A SaaS model for monetization would allow Sanford to offer developers pre-generated documentation with their themes/plugins. He is also exploring the possibility of offering the raw data in JSON, XML, CSV, etc. to vendors to implement an API microsite.</p>\n<p>For the time being, Sanford will continue investing time into improving Hookr as a reference and refining features according to user feedback.

This was certainly the case at WordCamp London 2015 where more than 200 people crammed into a small room to hear <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/jack-lenox-on-building-themes-with-the-wp-rest-api\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Lenox’s presentation on Building Themes with the WP REST API</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rachel-baker.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rachel-baker.jpeg?resize=140%2C140\" alt=\"rachel-baker\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-44126\" /></a>If you&#8217;re a developer who is ready to learn more about getting started with the API, you will not want to miss WPSessions&#8217; upcoming free live event. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelbaker\" target=\"_blank\">Rachel Baker</a>, lead engineer at <a href=\"http://thewirecutter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">The Wirecutter</a> and formerly a senior engineer at <a href=\"http://10up.com/\" target=\"_blank\">10up</a>, will be presenting on <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com/sessions/utilizing-the-wp-rest-api/\" target=\"_blank\">Utilizing the WP REST API</a> on Tuesday, May 26, 2015.</p>\n<p>Baker is one of the lead developers on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WP-API/WP-API\" target=\"_blank\">WP-API project</a> and is fully in tune with where it&#8217;s headed, as well as all the changes in the latest <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wp-rest-api-version-2-0-beta-1-released\" target=\"_blank\">2.0 beta release</a>. The topics she plans to cover will help developers dive in and start extending 2.0.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The content is driven by wanting to dig deeper with a more technical audience from the overview presentations you see at WordCamps and wanting to show off how easy it is to extend our version 2.0,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;This course is only 30-40 minutes, but if it goes well Brian would like to add more.&#8221;</p>\n<p>She plans to cover the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Installing the WP REST API</li>\n<li>Consuming core endpoints</li>\n<li>Creating custom endpoints</li>\n<li>Manipulating and Extending API results</li>\n<li>Preparing for future inclusion in WordPress core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;It is targeted at developers who are interested in seeing how they can use and customize the API,&#8221; Baker said. &#8220;Front-end and full-stack developers will see how to add additional fields to the existing endpoint responses. Plugin developers will see a demonstration of how to add their own endpoints. If you are interested in using the WP REST API, or have used version 1.x, you will want to see how version 2.0 works.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Baker&#8217;s session will essentially be a crash course in getting started, covering all the basics and more. While there has been a great deal of excitement surrounding the API and what it means for the future of WordPress, many developers are still getting a grasp on how they can incorporate it into real world projects. John James Jacoby made an interesting observation in his <a href=\"http://jaco.by/2015/05/14/loopconf/\" target=\"_blank\">recap of LoopConf</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>So many mentions of the REST API, but not a lot of truly practical usages yet – everyone is building WordPress minus WordPress instead of replacing existing piecemeal AJAX calls or iteratively improving WordPress itself.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Baker is planning to include practical examples in her presentation. One of her main objectives is to help developers get going with the 2.0 beta version so they can offer feedback as they continue to work with it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I can think of many practical uses, from powering interactions in a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-contact-forms/\" target=\"_blank\">Custom Contact Forms</a> to providing an API for a mobile app like <a href=\"https://storycorps.me/\" target=\"_blank\">StoryCorps.me</a>,&#8221; Baker said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our community is hearing that the WP REST API is going to <em>change WordPress</em> and they haven’t seen that happen. I don’t see the WP REST API as changing WordPress. I see the WP REST API as a WordPress feature that makes it easier to interact with your site’s data.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who haven&#8217;t been able to attend a session on the API in person have an excellent opportunity to see <a href=\"http://wpsessions.com/sessions/utilizing-the-wp-rest-api/\" target=\"_blank\">Baker&#8217;s WPSessions presentation</a> live for free on Tuesday, May 26th at 3pm EST (<a href=\"http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20150526T19&p1=1440&ah=1\" target=\"_blank\">UTC-4</a>).

In the following short interview, Hendriksen describes common pain points users experience with WordPress and shares advice for new users.</p>\n<h2>Short Interview with Hendriksen</h2>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wordpress-swag.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-17801\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/wordpress-swag.jpg?resize=1024%2C441\" alt=\"photo credit: Huasonic - cc\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/huasonic/3008912290/\">Huasonic</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p><strong>Which aspects of WordPress do users have the most trouble with?</strong></p>\n<p>Based on course feedback and a myriad of emails and questions on Twitter, the hangups people encounter when using WordPress fall into three main categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Installation and migration</li>\n<li>User interface and feature changes</li>\n<li>Theme and plugin inconsistencies</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Installation and Migration</h3>\n<p>More and more users create local installs to experiment before launching their sites, and they&#8217;re creating quite advanced sites on their local computers. When it comes time to migrate these sites, they often get stuck.</p>\n<p>I think this is partially due to lack of official and understandable documentation about migration, and partially because the general level of technical know-how necessary to build a local install is decreasing. Thanks to tools like MAMP/WAMP, BitNami, and ServerPress, more advanced skills like migration and external hosting become bigger steps up than they were previously.</p>\n<h3><strong>User Interface and Feature Changes</strong></h3>\n<p>As WordPress evolves, user interface changes are fairly common but in most cases, they are left unaddressed in release documentation. Recent examples include the removal of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/major-problems-with-image-editing-in-wp-39?replies=12\">Advanced Image Options</a> and <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-restore-the-link-title-attribute-removed-in-wordpress-4-2\">Link Title</a> from the editor modals. When changes like these are encountered by existing users, their first response is to assume they are doing something wrong or there is something wrong with their install.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, this is justifiable: In other software and in most other situations in the physical world, when a feature is removed or altered in such a way it is not easily found, this change is clearly addressed.</p>\n<p>In WordPress, it is usually only the large feature changes that are explained while the smaller ones are left for the user to discover on their own. When these features are part of the user&#8217;s workflow, that becomes a problem. This is further exacerbated when meta-conversations in the advanced community go public providing confusing and often contradictory information for new users.</p>\n<h3><strong>Theme and Plugin Inconsistencies</strong></h3>\n<p>The final grouping is the most obvious one. As the theme and plugin landscape becomes more diversified, users often feel overwhelmed and confused about what solutions to choose and how to use them. A search for membership plugins, business themes, or booking calendars returns hundreds if not thousands of widely different solutions that often have little in common.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, you can find blog posts and lists claiming that pretty much every one of them is the best one and the rest are inferior copies. On top of that, more and more themes and plugins are released as freemium offerings or shells that lead the user to a third-party service.</p>\n<p>All of this comes together to produce a confusing and frustrating user experience that leaves many users feeling like they are not smart enough to use the application or that they made a wrong choice in going with WordPress.</p>\n<p>These are all issues that could be resolved by creating consistent user experiences and by theme and plugin developer communities becoming more mindful of what kind of experiences they provide for the user when they ship freemium solutions or third-party up-sells.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPressRoadBlocks.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44073\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPressRoadBlocks.png?resize=650%2C200\" alt=\"WordPress Road Blocks\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/23559988@N05/2931537231\">Haven bridge road block</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p><strong>Are there more roadblocks to overcome than there were five years ago?</strong></p>\n<p>The answer to this question is both yes and no. WordPress has more roadblocks for the beginner, but for the more experienced user there are also more opportunities. I think one of the major challenges we are facing as a community is that WordPress is becoming too advanced for its core user base. The appeal of click-and-publish services like WIX and SquareSpace is that they do not require an in-depth understanding of the underpinnings of the application for it to work.</p>\n<p>In striving to become a full-fledged CMS for advanced developers and large publications, <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">WordPress has let itself drift away from its core philosophy of democratizing publishing by adding the very level of complexity it originally aimed to remove.</span> Combined with the theme and plugin issues described above and a lack of modern tools that users expect such as, drag-and-drop design tools and front-end editing, I see new users respond the same way to WordPress today that they did to Drupal five years ago.</p>\n<p>On the plus side, these roadblocks are more like speed bumps than fortified walls. With patience and access to well-crafted and easy to understand training materials, I stand by my claim that anyone, regardless of previous experience, can learn to build a great website with WordPress. What has changed is the level of complexity, both in use and in what you can produce.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPressAdviceForNewUsers.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-44085\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPressAdviceForNewUsers.png?resize=612%2C237\" alt=\"WordPress Advice For New Users\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/99329675@N02/11064947983\">What You Need To Know About Food Poisoning</a> &#8211; <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/\">(license)</a>\n<p><strong>What advice do you have for those new to WordPress?</strong></p>\n<p>My number one piece of advice for new and existing WordPress users is to always remember that WordPress is just a tool that makes it easy for you to put content in a database and your visitors to retrieve that content. When learning a new tool as technically advanced as WordPress, it is easy to get so caught up in the tool itself, that you forget what you wanted to do in the first place. Whatever your goals and intentions were when you picked up WordPress for the first time, make sure you remember them and keep working toward them.</p>\n<p>When learning WordPress, whether you are teaching yourself, learning from books or videos, or going to class, remember that every person in the community, even <a href=\"http://nacin.com/\">Andrew Nacin</a>, was at some point in time where you are now: <strong>Just trying to figure it all out</strong>. While every person&#8217;s path to learning is different, they all have one thing in common: <strong>They all learn from each other.</strong></p>\n<p>So reach out online, in person, through Twitter, Facebook groups, Meetups, WordCamps, and beyond, and find like-minded people who want to learn with you or help you on your way. When you meet someone who is just starting out, help them get their footing and invite them into the community.</p>\n<p>Finally, remember that WordPress is not an island. The web community is a rich ecosystem with many differing solutions based on the same core technology. Learning how the web works gives you the power to use WordPress to move beyond its borders and it&#8217;s beyond those borders where true magic is found.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 20 May 2015 19:21:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: WordPress.org is Testing International Theme and Plugin Directories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=44068\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-is-testing-international-theme-and-plugin-directories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3751:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flags.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/flags.jpg?resize=1020%2C500\" alt=\"flags\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16697\" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org is making strides towards fully localizing the project&#8217;s official theme and plugin directories. Dion Hulse <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2015/05/20/hi-everyone-as-some-of-you-are-aware/\" target=\"_blank\">posted</a> this morning that he has enabled localized theme directories for all Rosetta sites. For example, the Romanian themes directory is available at: <a href=\"https://ro.wordpress.org/themes/\" target=\"_blank\">ro.wordpress.org/themes/</a>.</p>\n<p>Theme filters, directory sub-navigation, info and download buttons, and other aspects of the details page are all translated. Description and titles are not yet translated, but Hulse says the plan is to add those in the near future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/romanian-themes.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/romanian-themes.png?resize=1025%2C677\" alt=\"romanian-themes\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44080\" /></a></p>\n<p>Those who are interested in helping translate the interface for the localized theme directories are encouraged to visit the <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/themes\" target=\"_blank\">meta translation project page</a>. The process for contributing is the same that is used with WordPress&#8217; other Rosetta translations.</p>\n<p>Localized plugin directories are being actively tested at /plugins/ and the sites are also <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/meta/plugins\" target=\"_blank\">available for contributions from translators</a>. Check out <a href=\"https://ro.wordpress.org/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\">ro.wordpress.org/plugins/</a> to see the Romanian plugin directory as an example.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/romanian-plugins.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/romanian-plugins.png?resize=1025%2C685\" alt=\"romanian-plugins\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-44079\" /></a></p>\n<p>As the localized theme and plugin directories are new, there are still a few missing pieces and likely a good number of bugs that will need to be resolved. You can help by reporting them on Hulse&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2015/05/20/hi-everyone-as-some-of-you-are-aware/\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> on the make.wordperss.org/polyglots blog or by opening a ticket on <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/newticket?component=Theme%20Directory\" target=\"_blank\">meta.trac</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenwegs-state-of-the-word-highlights-internationalization-mobile-and-new-tools-for-wordpress-contributors\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s 2014 State of the Word address</a>, he highlighted the importance of internationalization improvements for connecting and growing the global WordPress community. Localized directories for plugins and themes on WordPress.org are part of this larger effort and make the project&#8217;s website easier to navigate for non-English speaking users.</p>\n<p>In the future, translation of WordPress&#8217; development handbooks, the codex, and other documentation could also play a large part towards inspiring international developers to make more extensions, products for the marketplace, and contributions back to the project.

It quickly became popular and paved the way for hundreds of shops to follow in their footsteps.</p>\n<p>With the leadership of Adii Pienaar and co-founders Mark Forrester and Magnus Jepson, WooThemes did a ton of interesting things over the years, and dominated the market with a handful of other shops. They <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2011/09/woocommerce-has-arrived/\">launched WooCommerce in September 2011</a>, in the middle of the commercial theme heyday.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce&#8217;s origins are a hot mess and a long story. WooThemes worked for a long time to develop, with partners, their own eCommerce solution. After numerous failed attempts and false starts, they hired <a href=\"http://mikejolley.com/\">Mike Jolley</a> and <a href=\"http://jameskoster.co.uk/\">Jay Koster</a> full time, and forked JigoShop after acquisition negotiations broke down. Jigoshop is a product that Mike and Jay built as freelancers for JigoWatt, but has since been sold off to another consulting company.</p>\n<p>Mike and Jay were, and are, the heart of that eCommerce plugin &#8212; the one we know today as WooCommerce. Under their stewardship, and dozens of other full time and part time contributors &#8212; mixed in with outstanding marketing, perfect timing, and a lack of modern competition &#8212; WooCommerce took the WordPress world by storm.</p>\n<p>They pioneered the extension model for paid add-ons. They put all doubters to rest over and over again. They made mistakes. But they kept at it, kept working, kept making it better. And soon enough, they took the eCommerce world by storm too.</p>\n<p>In a short period of four years, WooCommerce has gone from a struggling concept, to a fork, to a remarkable open source commercial software success story.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had the privilege of following WooThemes since around the time they started, and have gotten to know the project and their team even more closely since the very early days of WooCommerce&#8217;s launch. In this post, I bring my analysis of the company based on those years of my watching them grow and interacting with them, and hope to share what the acquisition by Automattic may mean for the future.</p>\n<h3>Why WooCommerce is attractive</h3>\n<p>On the surface, it may seem to many that Automattic was the obvious choice to acquire WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>After all, they need eCommerce support for <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">WordPress.com</a>. As Matt Mullenweg shared with me, they, &#8220;have a ton of demand,&#8221; for eCommerce from WordPress.com users. Acquiring WooCommerce gives Automattic access to the largest single group of eCommerce stores in the world.</p>\n<h4>One of many options</h4>\n<p>But Mark Forrester and Magnus Jepson &#8212; co-founders and owners of WooThemes &#8212; could have gone many other routes.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is big enough, and has enough brand power, to have attracted significant venture capital investments, as well as suitors from well outside the WordPress space &#8212; suitors like MasterCard, eBay/Paypal, Amazon, or Yahoo.</p>\n<p>There are 1.2+ million active installs of WooCommerce. They have a nearly <a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/shop\">20% eCommerce marketshare</a> of the top one million websites, and over 24% eCommerce marketshare of all websites.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12685\" src=\"https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/woocommerce-builtwith-top-million.png\" alt=\"woocommerce-builtwith-top-million\" width=\"631\" height=\"499\" /></p>\n<p>The plugin has had rapid growth over its short four year existence, making it a ripe target for the right buyer.</p>\n<h4>A natural fit</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce&#8217;s popularity has largely been due to the fact that it&#8217;s available on WordPress. WordPress makes WooCommerce an attractive choice for websites that need bolt-on eCommerce.</p>\n<p>One of WooCommerce&#8217;s greatest opportunities for growth is for customers that are eCommerce first, other-parts-of-the-website second. It&#8217;s gaining ground quickly as both WooCommerce and WordPress gain further respect for usage on websites of all sizes and scopes.</p>\n<p>All of these factors make WooCommerce an attractive choice for Automattic. Automattic&#8217;s team knows, understands, and contributes greatly to the WordPress project. A shared reliance on WordPress core makes a WooCommerce and WordPress.com integration simpler. And 55 talented, eCommerce focused employees makes for an inviting addition to Automattic&#8217;s relatively small workforce.</p>\n<h3>18% growth in Automattic employees</h3>\n<p>Bringing 55 new people on at once swells Automattic&#8217;s ranks by around 18%, bringing them to over 360 people. Recruiting is not easy. This gain of talented people, in a single fell swoop, should not be underestimated.</p>\n<p>But there may be some challenges integrating the two teams. This is, by far, the most people brought under the Automattic umbrella in a single acquisition.</p>\n<h4>Team integration</h4>\n<p>WooThemes&#8217; theme division and team members will join Automattic&#8217;s theme team, and it&#8217;s my understanding that WooThemes support will join the Happiness team at Automattic as well.</p>\n<p>WooThemes has long battled a significant support burden, even before WooCommerce came along. With the demands of supporting eCommerce software that can conflict with nearly infinite plugins, themes, and hosting environments makes support expensive. As long as WooCommerce offers paid self-hosted products, this support will need to be managed.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce will certainly benefit from the developer resources at Automattic. Matt told me, &#8220;lots of folks at Automattic [are] interested in working on eCommerce.&#8221; From code audits, to fresh eyes, to more seasoned developers, Automattic&#8217;s team will be able to have an immediate impact on the WooCommerce product line.</p>\n<h4>Merging management</h4>\n<p>One aspect I don&#8217;t know much about yet is in regard to WooThemes&#8217; middle management. Mark and Magnus own the company, but there is a four person leadership team beyond them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Joel Bronkowski, Chief Business Development Officer</li>\n<li>Warren Holmes, Chief Marketing Officer</li>\n<li>Matty Cohen, Chief Product Officer</li>\n<li>Michael Krapf, Chief Happiness Officer</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Furthermore, there are product leads for WooCommerce, Sensei, themes, and other elements of WooThemes&#8217; business. As a company, WooThemes is probably as hierarchical as Automattic with six times fewer people.</p>\n<p>I anticipate some managers may merge into other Automattic teams under new roles, or play a part in sub-teams of sorts, which is (I believe) how Jetpack works now that it&#8217;s such a big team.</p>\n<h4>Already distributed</h4>\n<p>WooThemes is already distributed across five continents and perfectly accustomed to remote work. While they have an office (WooHQ) in Cape Town, South Africa, it&#8217;s a &#8220;come as you please&#8221; environment, similar to Automattic&#8217;s San Francisco space.</p>\n<p>Joining Automattic will be a much cleaner culture fit than other potential buyers would have been. Some team members will naturally leave or integrate to other roles, but the overall gain is a huge win for both organizations.</p>\n<h3>The likely end of &#8220;WooThemes&#8221; as a name</h3>\n<p>WooThemes is a staple brand of the WordPress ecosystem. They&#8217;ve been around since 2008 and probably have the biggest single brand presence after WordPress itself; I&#8217;d argue the name is more well-known than Automattic, or even perhaps ThemeForest.</p>\n<p>For all practical purposes, I believe the name WooThemes will be retired.</p>\n<p>WooThemes has previously considered a name change to reflect the change in their business focus, but have not done it. Under the umbrella of Automattic and WordPress.com, there is really no need to carry on the WooThemes brand.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m told the decision to change the name of the website hasn&#8217;t been officially made yet, but it makes no sense to me to keep WooThemes. I&#8217;d expect the website we see at WooThemes.com to before long be simply <a href=\"http://woocommerce.com\">WooCommerce.com</a>.</p>\n<p>They better keep Hiro, the Woo Ninja though. I love that little guy.</p>\n<h3>The WooCommerce business model</h3>\n<p>The WooCommerce business model is built largely on paid extensions that offer additional eCommerce functionality, updates, and support.</p>\n<h4>The current extension model</h4>\n<p>WooThemes lists a whopping 346 paid and free extensions on their website, about 150 of which link to third party sites. The remaining 200 or so extensions are either developed in house or in partnership with third party developers, but sold on WooThemes&#8217; website. There are also dozens, if not hundreds more, distributed plugins by other vendors that are not listed.</p>\n<p>Companies like <a href=\"https://www.skyverge.com/\">SkyVerge</a> and <a href=\"http://prospress.com/\">Prospress</a> have built their businesses on WooCommerce extension development. If the model were to change drastically, it could have a great deal of impact on them and similar companies or solo developers.</p>\n<p>Third party developers have been told that life will be business as usual. In an email to strategic partners, Joel Bronkowski said, &#8220;There are no plans to mess with the magic sauce strategy that has brought us this far.&#8221;</p>\n<h4>A conflict of ideology</h4>\n<p>However, the model of paid plugins is also counter to Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s often stated beliefs for what commercialization in the WordPress plugin space should look like.</p>\n<p>I asked him to explain how his mindset has changed in regard to paid plugins that charge for support and updates. Paid Automattic plugins, like Akismet and VaultPress, are based on SaaS models.</p>\n<p>He says that his view has not changed. He told me that one goal with WooCommerce will be to determine, &#8220;what services provide the most value to people over a long period of time.&#8221; He also noted that such a question is due to the fact that many WordPress product sales are one-time.</p>\n<p>I found his sentiment curious. He didn&#8217;t directly answer the question about paid plugins, which isn&#8217;t too surprising. It&#8217;s impossible to imagine Automattic doing away with paid extensions in the short term, but there are serious threats to third party developers in the longer term, I believe.</p>\n<h4>Expansion of partnerships with larger corporations</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce has spent a lot of time doing business development over the last couple of years. Last summer, their leadership team <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2014/07/woocommerce-journey-irce-2014/\">went to Chicago</a> for a big eCommerce conference and had a whole new world opened up to them.</p>\n<p>Joel told me they, &#8220;still have a lot to figure out in terms of the road ahead, but [we are] incredibly excited about what this means for us in terms of product development, partner opportunities and for WordPress powered eCommerce.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Under the wing of Automattic and in the future WordPress.com, I think WooCommerce will be able to further leverage their position in the eCommerce market with big payment companies and other potential corporate entities.</p>\n<h4>Potential changes to the business model</h4>\n<p>I would guess that a gradual change in business model will occur over the next several years, especially in regard to extensions. <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">WooCommerce has a dismal 17% renewal rate for extension purchases.</span> This is a number that needs to improve, or something should change.</p>\n<p>It may make sense &#8212; and I&#8217;m shocked I&#8217;m saying it &#8212; to make WooCommerce more like Jetpack.</p>\n<p>If I were at Automattic, I would encourage the two teams to brainstorm and evolve together. I think a model where a credit card is connected to WordPress.com, and extensions (free and paid) can be easily activated from within the admin makes sense. It would require a lot of change to existing UIs and development infrastructure, but it could also drastically improve what is often a convoluted method for site management with so many add-ons being independently managed.</p>\n<p>If we take the potential even further: imagine the VaultPress model of instant syncing, data tracking, and backups being heavily integrated into eCommerce stores. Such a system could be part of a monthly fee.</p>\n<p>Extensions also don&#8217;t have to be piecemeal, or the &#8220;nickel and dime&#8221; method. Automattic could make WooCommerce a tiered payment plan, where certain levels unlock particular functionality. Or they could buyout all third party paid extensions they care about and make the entire product free or part of a single package.</p>\n<p>The point is that Automattic purchasing WooCommerce gives them an incredible amount of flexibility in terms of how to move forward. WooCommerce store owners should be prepared for a lot of potential change.</p>\n<p>As a bootstrapped company, WooThemes had to turn a profit. Automattic has to make the company more valuable, but does not need to care about cash day to day. Their stated goal is to make products people want to use. <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">A very small number of people at Automattic really consider profits and losses regularly. That mindset, when applied to WooCommerce, could bring about significant change indeed.</span></p>\n<h4>Bringing WooCommerce to WordPress.com</h4>\n<p>An important concern over the next year or two will be how to bring WooCommerce to WordPress.com. There is little question that it will happen.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg highlighted the demand from the general WordPress.com userbase, and hosted WooCommerce would be a great answer to Squarespace&#8217;s eCommerce add-on, and the likes of Shopify and BigCartel.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I&#8217;m sure a number of WordPress.com VIP customers will be clamoring for WooCommerce. Automattic&#8217;s Vice President of Platform Services, Paul Maiorana, said, &#8220;VIP tends to follow the same trends as the broader WP community. Initially blogs, then CMS, now everything.&#8221; He is excited about being able to offer a more catered eCommerce experience &#8220;in house to better service those customers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A hosted version of WooCommerce will be a very compelling upsell for WordPress.com if they are able to pull it off well. This too, will not be easy. But they are starting with a heck of a head start, given the WooCommerce brand name, team, and existing plugin infrastructure.</p>\n<h3>What the acquisition means for other WooThemes products</h3>\n<p>WooThemes makes more than WooCommerce, however nearly all of their products today at least integrate with WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>WooThemes&#8217; themes will be integrated into WordPress.com&#8217;s theme offering. Eleven themes are <a href=\"https://theme.wordpress.com/?theme_shop=woothemes\">already listed there</a> from an existing partnership that goes back to early 2011.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/\">Sensei courseware plugin</a> will also continue to be developed and maintained. Regarding Sensei, Matt Mullenweg said, &#8220;their team is passionate about it, which is kind of the criteria for what Automattic works on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There is a lot of potential in the course space, and I actually think this could be a nice win for Automattic in this acquisition, especially if Sensei gets additional resources and attention.</p>\n<p>WooThemes has other active free plugins that I doubt will change much. WooSlider is their only other paid plugin, but I don&#8217;t think it makes up a considerable amount of revenue.</p>\n<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if both WooSlider and Sensei core become free plugins.</p>\n<h3>WooThemes&#8217; revenue and the acquisition price</h3>\n<p>Everyone wants to know: how much was WooThemes making, and how much was the acquisition for?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://recode.net/2015/05/19/wordpress-parent-automattic-buys-woocommerce-a-shopping-tool-for-web-publishers/\">Re/code&#8217;s Peter Kafka</a> has sources that say the acquisition was for, &#8220;more than $30 million in cash and stock.&#8221; I believe this to be a reasonable amount and I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d make the claim without some confidence.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what the terms of the deal were. I&#8217;ve tried all day to find out. The best I can do is tell you what I know, what I think I know, and guess right along with everyone else. Sounds fun, right?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m quite confident that WooThemes&#8217; revenues were around $9-$10 million in 2013. I also know that they have had positive trajectory month over month growth for some time, and I have reason to believe one of their more recent record months well exceeded $1 million in revenue.</p>\n<p>If we extrapolate the 2013 numbers with 10-20% growth, we can presume that their gross revenues are somewhere in the neighborhood of $15 million annually.</p>\n<p>Based on some feedback from people I trust, a 2x multiple of expected 2015 revenues isn&#8217;t out of the question. In typical proprietary software and product situations, that would be a low multiplier.</p>\n<p>But in this case, WooThemes&#8217; sends a lot of money directly to third party developers, and spends a great deal of money on development and support. Furthermore, WooCommerce isn&#8217;t proprietary, it&#8217;s open source; which while I love and advocate for it, it simply would be difficult to valuate the same as proprietary software.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I could be naive, but in the case of Automattic I&#8217;d rather more stock than cash. They are destined for an IPO (someday) that will likely put them well beyond their latest <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/\">$1.16 billion valuation</a>, and today&#8217;s stock could be worth many times what it is now in the years to come.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I don&#8217;t think Re/code would run a number they pulled out of thin air. I think they got that from somewhere &#8212; perhaps a VC source.</p>\n<h3>Good for both sides, but not without consequences</h3>\n<p>I firmly believe WooThemes could&#8217;ve continued to grow WooCommerce to be worth $100 million or more. But it would&#8217;ve likely been a long and challenging road.</p>\n<p>Under the Automattic umbrella, they have a great shot to continue making an awesome eCommerce product without some of their current burdens and with some outstanding new resources.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, especially if the $30-$35 million price is correct, I think Automattic got a steal. It&#8217;s a brilliant way into a huge market with a major player.</p>\n<p>There are potential downsides to this purchase. For one, it makes Automattic further feel like a vacuum that inevitably sucks up the best talent, agencies, and products once they showcase their potential for success.</p>\n<p>WooThemes was the bastion all other bootstrapped WordPress products stood behind. Knowing it&#8217;s possible to do something as big as WooThemes was doing, without funding and starting from nothing, is awesome.</p>\n<p>Seeing them snatched up by Automattic around the time they&#8217;ve become nearly ubiquitous with the term &#8220;WordPress eCommerce&#8221; is kind of a bummer. <span class=\"pullquote alignright\">It&#8217;s like we now have to start over again to see what WordPress centric product company can grow big enough to stand beside Automattic, not under it.</span></p>\n<p>I also have some fear that if Automattic rocks the boat too much with WooCommerce it will cause some big inroads WordPress has made in self-hosted eCommerce to be lost.</p>\n<p>My concerns are relatively minor. Would I have loved to see WooThemes continue to grow and dominate eCommerce alone? Yes. Am I excited by what this deal makes possible? Yes. Am I a little concerned what it will do to the WordPress economy? Yes.</p>\n<p>We must all weigh the pros and cons of any decision. For Mark, Magnus, and the WooThemes team, this is a move that is good for them during this time, and will likely be good for the company they started seven years ago.</p>\n<p>For Automattic, this is a heck of a way to round out their first decade in business. It&#8217;ll be really interesting to see what the next decade holds in store, but I bet Automattic will look a lot different then, like they do now compared to 2005.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to both teams.

The <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> recently passed seven million downloads and stats from BuiltWith show that <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-dominates-global-e-commerce-platforms-passes-7-million-downloads\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce is dominating global e-commerce platforms</a>, powering roughly 30% of all online stores.</p>\n<p>This is Automattic&#8217;s largest acquisition to date, bringing 55 new employees into the company from 16 countries for a total of 370 Automatticians. Mullenweg confirmed that the acquisition includes <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Woo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/products/sensei/\" target=\"_blank\">Sensei</a>, and all of the other plugins and themes.</p>\n<p>Given WooCommerce&#8217;s extensive adoption on the web, Automattic will not be re-branding the newly acquired products. WooThemes and WooCommerce will continue to be sold via their dedicated websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We’re planning on retaining (and growing) the WooCommerce brand,&#8221; Mullenweg told the Tavern. &#8220;The plan is to keep what has been working going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg has spoken frequently over the years about growing Automattic&#8217;s reach into global commerce, but few could have predicted that the company would acquire Woo as opposed to building its own in-house commerce platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They have a full team that goes to bed every night and wakes up in the morning thinking about commerce; it’s core to their DNA,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;That’s better than starting it in-house. Also they have a ton of adoption already.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In April, WooThemes co-founder Magnus Jepson told the Tavern that <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-dominates-global-e-commerce-platforms-passes-7-million-downloads\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce accounts for over 85% of overall sales</a> and processes &#8220;several million dollars per year.” Jepson also confirmed that WooCommerce&#8217;s revenue &#8220;has been climbing steadily over the past few years, and we are regularly breaking monthly revenue records.”</p>\n<p>Automattic is not releasing the financial details of the acquisition, but <a href=\"http://recode.net/2015/05/19/wordpress-parent-automattic-buys-woocommerce-a-shopping-tool-for-web-publishers/\" target=\"_blank\">Re/code speculates</a> that it was in the range of $30 million:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Sources say Automattic will spend more than $30 million in cash and stock to buy the 55-person company. Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg wouldn’t comment on the price but said the acquisition was the largest his company had made, &#8216;by about 6x.&#8217;</p></blockquote>\n<p>In addition to growing the current WooCommerce customer base, Automattic is looking to use the platform to add more selling options for WordPress.com customers, while retaining its existing e-commerce partnerships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Partnerships will remain in place on WP.com, but long-term we’d like to offer Woo as an option there as well,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>When asked about plans to integrate WooCommerce into Jetpack, he said, &#8220;Jetpack could definitely complement WooCommerce (and WooThemes), but not the other way around.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooThemes founders never imagined that WooCommerce would rise to the level of popularity that it has, ultimately bringing them into the Automattic family. Co-founder Mark Forrester <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2015/05/woothemes-joins-automattic/\" target=\"_blank\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In 2008, as three strangers in three countries, we set out on a quest to pioneer WordPress commercial theming, never dreaming of the rocket-propelled voyage into the self-hosted eCommerce unknown that lay ahead. It’s been an incredible ride, backed by a unique community, and here we find ourselves powering over 24% of online stores with our flagship product, WooCommerce.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The acquisition affects a whole fleet of third-party designers and developers who create products for WooCommerce. They will likely have more opportunities and sales ahead of them with the power of Automattic behind the core plugin. Mullenweg confirmed that the next WooConf, scheduled to take place in Austin in November, will continue on as planned. Those who are heavily involved in the WooCommerce ecosystem will still be able to connect and build for the platform as they have done previously.</p>\n<h3>Democratizing Selling with WooCommerce</h3>\n<p>With Automattic now at the helm of the most dominant e-commerce platform on the web, it will be interesting to see if the company can make selling online just as simple as it has made publishing online. WordPress.com&#8217;s tremendous success can be partially attributed to the company&#8217;s <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-on-ensuring-the-future-of-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">commitment to democratizing publishing</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>&#8220;I do believe that the web needs an open, independent and easy-to-use commerce platform that you can run yourself on your own website,&#8221;</strong> Mullenweg said in his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJOfTB8-daA\" target=\"_blank\">video announcement</a>, the first video ever to be published to Automattic&#8217;s YouTube account.</p>\n<p>Publishing products and selling them on the web is arguably a more complex endeavor than simple publishing, especially when you factor in location, tax, payment gateways, and everything needed to process transactions. The average non-developer has no concept of what it takes to set up a blog, let alone an online store. But if Automattic can play a part in democratizing the ability for regular folks to sell products online, it has the potential to globally transform e-commerce.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 19 May 2015 21:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"Matt: Woo &amp; Automattic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45068\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4529:\"<p>For years, we&#8217;ve been working on democratizing publishing, and today more people have independent sites built on open source software than ever before in the history of the web.

Everyone applauded; there’s long been demand for better ecommerce functionality, but it’s been outside the scope of what Automattic could do well.</p>\n<p>That changes today &#8212; drum roll &#8212; as <a href=\"http://woocommerce.com/\">WooCommerce</a> joins the <a href=\"http://automattic.com/\">Automattic</a> team to make it easier for people to sell online. <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/2015/05/woothemes-joins-automattic/\">Along with Woo’s announcement</a>, here&#8217;s a short video explaining more:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\"></span></p>\n<p>In the past few years, WooCommerce really distinguished itself in its field. Just like WordPress as a whole, it developed a robust community around its software, and its products meet the needs of hundreds of thousands of people around the world.</p>\n<p>Woo is also a team after Automattic’s own distributed heart: WooCommerce is created and supported by 55 people in 16 countries. Added to Automattic&#8217;s 325 people in 37 countries, that’s a combined 380-person company across 42 countries &#8212; the sun never sets.* I can&#8217;t wait to meet all my new colleagues.</p>\n<p>Just like us, the vast majority of WooCommerce&#8217;s work is also open source and 100% GPL. And just like WordPress, you&#8217;ll find WooCommerce meetups popping up everywhere, from Los Angeles to London, and its global and community-focused work together to make the users’ experiences the best they can be.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/shop\"><img class=\"alignright  wp-image-45072\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2015/05/ecomm-trends.png?resize=447%2C294\" alt=\"ecomm-trends\" /></a> The stats are impressive: the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\">WooCommerce plugin has over 7.5 million downloads and a million+ active installs</a>; BuiltWith&#8217;s <a href=\"http://trends.builtwith.com/shop\">survey of ecommerce platforms shows Woo passing up Magento in the top million</a>, with about triple the number of total sites. Even a conservative estimate that WooCommerce powers 650,000 storefronts means they’re enabling a huge number of independent sellers. They’ve added a tremendous amount to the WordPress ecosystem (alongside everyone else working in this area).</p>\n<p>WordPress currently <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all/y\">powers about 23% of the web</a>. As we work our way toward 51%, WooCommerce joining Automattic is a big step opening WordPress up to an entirely new audience. I can’t wait to see how much more we can build together.</p>\n<p>Automattic <em>turns ten</em> next month: another amazing milestone I couldn&#8217;t have imagined a decade ago.

The <strong>do_action( ‘wordpress-charity-hackathon’ );</strong> event was so successful in 2014 that organizers were inspired to make it an annual event. The <a href=\"http://www.wpcapetown.co.za/event/do_action-wordpress-charity-hackathon-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">2015 hackathon</a> is scheduled for June 20th from 9:00 AM &#8211; 5:00 PM.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With a team of nearly 50 volunteers from the community, we built brand new websites for nine different charitable organizations and we will be doing the same again this year,&#8221; said Hugh Lashbrooke, an organizer for the event.</p>\n<p>The concept will be the same as the previous year &#8211; volunteers will build sites for nine Capetown-based charities, giving each their own unique online presence by the end of the day.</p>\n<p>A few examples of websites built by the volunteers last year include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://feedinginaction.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Feeding in Action</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.stlukes.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">St. Luke’s Hospice</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.equinoxtrust.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Equinox Trust</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.carecareers.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Care Career Connection</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.theup.org.za/\" target=\"_blank\">The UPliftment Porgramme</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;The charities this year are equally as deserving and spread across the whole spectrum of society again,&#8221; Lashbrooke said. The 2015 charities list includes organizations such as the Academy for Adults with Autism, FoodBank South Africa, and the Down Syndrome Inclusive Education Foundation NPC.</p>\n<p>Sponsors this year include <a href=\"http://hetzner.co.za/\" target=\"_blank\">Hetzner</a>, <a href=\"http://oboxthemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Obox</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.woothemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WooThemes</a>.

Kurland is GoDaddy&#8217;s evangelist who travels to WordCamps and is the interface between various open source communities and GoDaddy.</p>\n<p>In the following post, Kurland shares his experience attending <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015\">DrupalCon Los Angeles</a>, a large conference devoted to <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/\">Drupal</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As I flew from DrupalCon Los Angeles, CA to <a href=\"https://mendel.me/events/wordcamp/wordcamp-maine-2015/\">WordCamp Maine</a>, I thought a lot about what the Drupal and WordPress communities could learn from each other. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> and Drupal are two community-built platforms and each community is powerful. We stand to learn a lot from each other, because<a href=\"https://mendel.me/articles/business/why-all-open-source-projects-matter/\"> all open source projects matter</a>.</p>\n<p>With an eye toward looking for the similarities, rather than the differences, both WordPress and Drupal are working to overcome similar obstacles including, brand recognition, threat mitigation, adoption, onboarding, contribution, the list goes on. So why did I go to <a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015\">DrupalCon LA</a>? To learn and give back to another community that’s steeped in collaborative culture.</p>\n<h2>The Experience</h2>\n<p>Thousands of people attended <a href=\"https://mendel.me/events/drupalcon/drupalcon-la/\">DrupalCon in Los Angeles</a> this year. It’s massive and the layout is similar to a large developer conference. There are sessions centered on technical, as well as business topics, and usually lively question and answer opportunities after each session. There’s a coder lounge, a contribution room, and a huge emphasis on contributing to coding sprints for the next release of Drupal, Drupal 8.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DrupalConLA.png\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-43971\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/DrupalConLA.png?resize=1024%2C683\" alt=\"DrupalCon LA\" /></a>Photo via <a href=\"https://mendel.me/events/drupalcon/drupalcon-la/#jp-carousel-16491\">Mendel</a>\n<h2>Leveling and Onboarding</h2>\n<p>Prior to the conference, DrupalCon had summits to help gather community members around a particular vertical or topic such as, higher education, community, business, and training sessions to help level-up skills based on experience.</p>\n<p>The theme of organizing around common interests is strong throughout the entire conference with<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/bofs/2015-05-12\"> birds of a feather sessions</a> and<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/events\"> topical social gatherings</a> with topics like,<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/women-drupal\"> women in Drupal</a> and<a href=\"https://events.drupal.org/losangeles2015/first-time-attendee-social\"> first time attendees</a>. When it comes to mobilizing around interest groups, Drupal does a brilliant job.</p>\n<h2>Comparing WordPress and Drupal</h2>\n<p>I’ve met a higher proportion of people who work on enterprise sites at DrupalCons and a higher proportion of people who work on small business sites at DrupalCamps, local conferences similar to WordCamps. There are some important lessons, however, that I took away from the Drupal community.</p>\n<h2><b>Lessons and Questions from DrupalCon</b></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Onboarding starts with education. The Drupal community puts an emphasis on training at just about every event while only a handful of WordCamps offer a <strong>Foundation Friday</strong> or some other local onboarding event.</li>\n<li>Building community means valuing the same things and aligning along common interests. BoF (Birds of a Feather) sessions are a part of Drupal and other technical community conferences. There are certainly people with specific interests related to performance, security, women in WordPress, WP-CLI, etc. Should the WordPress community offer BoF sessions at WordCamps? Or are the existing <strong>tracks</strong> that many WordCamps offer enough?</li>\n<li>Networking with those who work in a similar vertical is important. Just as Drupal holds summits for particular verticals, the WordPress community is beginning to do the same with things like, <a href=\"https://miami.wordcamp.org/2015/announcing-buddycamp-miami-2015/\">BuddyCamp at WordCamp Miami</a>, <a href=\"http://conf.woocommerce.com/\">WooConf</a> (e-commerce), <a href=\"http://pressnomics.com/\">Pressnomics</a> (business), <a href=\"http://prestigeconf.com/\">Prestige</a> (business), <a href=\"https://loopconf.io/\">LoopConf</a> (developer). Can more be done at WordCamps?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>It&#8217;s OK to Love Drupal Too</h2>\n<p>If you’re reading this article on the Tavern, you’re likely a WordPress loyalist. I love WordPress, and it’s also <strong>ok to love Drupal</strong>. They are both tools in an open source toolbox that we all share. The beauty of our opportunity as developers, designers, and creative professionals is our ability to create awesome things in a million different ways.</p>\n<p>In going to DrupalCon, it was refreshing for me to take a second to see the web development industry from another perspective.

At the end of 2003, just six months after Matt Mullenweg and Mike Little <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\" target=\"_blank\">decided to fork b2</a>, a Japanese version of WordPress was available.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPress-ME.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/WordPress-ME.jpg?resize=748%2C299\" alt=\"WordPress-ME\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43607\" /></a></p>\n<p>The version was originally called &#8220;WordPress ME&#8221; and was maintained by a user called <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/otsukare/\" target=\"_blank\">Otsukare</a>, whose <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20040802092512/http://wordpress.xwd.jp/\" target=\"_blank\">translation notes</a> indicate that he believed WordPress would become &#8220;convenient and increasingly easy to use in the future.&#8221; This Japanese version corresponded with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2003/10/072-final-version-available/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress 0.72</a>, as WordPress wouldn&#8217;t have internationalization support until version 1.2.</p>\n<p>Otsukare was instrumental in demonstrating the demand for translation for all languages with the popularity of his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/localization-help-needed\" target=\"_blank\">multilingual fork of WordPress</a>, which allowed easy modification via the use of a language file. It is rumored that this multilingual edition, along with discussions on the WordPress ME fourms, was influential in bringing <a href=\"https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/gettext\" target=\"_blank\">gettext</a> into WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Growing the Japanese WordPress Community Through Local Meetups</h2>\n<p>Over the past 11 years, local Japanese WordPress communities have grown steadily. <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/Nao\" target=\"_blank\">Naoko Takano</a>, who has been involved with the local community since 2003, attributes that growth to <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/naokomc/wordcamp-europe2013\" target=\"_blank\">consistent translation and a reliable release workflow</a>, managed by a dedicated Japanese package team.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/japanese-package-team.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/japanese-package-team.jpg?resize=625%2C247\" alt=\"japanese-package-team\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43918\" /></a></p>\n<p>An organized system around translation and documentation were two key ingredients that helped germinate the early Japanese WordPress community, but local meetups were ultimately the catalyst for its massive growth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?tags=wordcamptokyo2008\" target=\"_blank\">The first WordCamp Tokyo</a> was held in 2008 with 60 attendees. <a href=\"https://tokyo.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Tokyo</a> today now pulls in 1200 &#8211; 1400 people, according to co-organizer <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shinichin\" target=\"_blank\">Shinichi Nishikawa</a>. This event is larger than past editions of WordCamps Europe and San Francisco.</p>\n<p>Nishikawa reports that over the past seven years, Japan has hosted 15 WordCamps in Tokyo, Kyoto, Fukuoka, Yokohama Nagoyo, Kobe, and Osaka. <a href=\"https://kansai.wordcamp.org/2014/\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Kansai</a>, held in the Western part of the country, was organized by WordBench members of that area, including Shiga, Kyoto, Osaka, Hyogo, Nara and Wakayama.</p>\n<p>Regional WordPress groups in Japan are organized on <a href=\"http://WordBench.org\" target=\"_blank\">WordBench.org</a>, a site that allows users to find, join, and create a meetup. The site was <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2009/04/30/wordcamp-tokyo-2009-takayuki-miyoshi-introducing-wordpress-regional-community-wordbench/\" target=\"_blank\">created in 2009 by Takayuki Miyoshi</a>, the author of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/\" target=\"_blank\">Contact Form 7</a>, one of WordPress&#8217; most popular plugins. WordBench has been running on BuddyPress for the past six years and was originally built on RC1 of the plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordbench.png\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordbench.png?resize=1025%2C672\" alt=\"wordbench\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43929\" /></a></p>\n<p>The site currently lists 48 local groups throughout Japan, named for their cities, i.e. WordBench Tokyo, WordBench Osaka, WordBench Kawasaki. Members and organizers use the site to post about upcoming events and recaps of meetups recently held in various locations. The site serves to keep Japan&#8217;s local communities connected and inspired.</p>\n<h2>Japan&#8217;s Unique WordPress Meetups and the Importance of Wapuu</h2>\n<p>In addition to the regional WordBench groups, interest-based meetups are also common in the Japanese WordPress community. In this format, members meet around different interests outside of WordPress, such as cooking or photography. For example, the <a href=\"https://shashinbu.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPhotoclub</a> meetup gathers together to go on walks and take photos. Members&#8217; <a href=\"http://8bitodyssey.com/archives/1547\" target=\"_blank\">photos</a> were printed and displayed at WordCamp Tokyo 2012.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://takamorry.com/article/20130209_wordcrab.html\" target=\"_blank\">WordCrab</a> is another example of one of Japan&#8217;s unique WordPress meetups. Members from all over from Japan gather in the Fukui prefecture, where they combine WordPress sessions with a giant <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=wordcrab&l=commderiv&ss=0&ct=0&mt=all&w=all&adv=1\" target=\"_blank\">crab party</a> where everyone feasts upon the region&#8217;s renowned crabs.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordcrab.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wordcrab.jpg?resize=1025%2C586\" alt=\"photo credit: WordCrab meetup\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43936\" /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=wordcrab&l=commderiv&ss=0&ct=0&mt=all&w=all&adv=1\">WordCrab meetup</a>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://2014onsen.wbsendai.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Word温泉 (WordOnsen) meetup</a> is centered around the enjoyment of hot springs. Members gather in Fukushima and stay at a hotel where they have WordPress sessions and a party night.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In meetups we started doing more things than just learning WordPress,&#8221; community organizer Shinichi Nishikawa said. &#8220;We get friends together and go for a walk and eat lunch/dinner together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think this a really good way to make the community stronger. <span class=\"pullquote alignleft\">People are talented in different things and by doing something together, other than WordPress, people can show their talents.</span> And of course, it’s fun.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Japan&#8217;s holistic approach to meetups incorporates various aspects of life and relationships, as opposed to simply centering around improving WordPress technical skill. As a result, members become more connected and meetups are highly personalized. That&#8217;s where Wapuu enters the picture to bring special meaning to each group.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ja.wordpress.org/about-wp-ja/wapuu/\" target=\"_blank\">Wapuu</a>, the official mascot character of WordPress, was designed by Kazuko Kaneuchi in 2011. It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://github.com/jawordpressorg/wapuu\" target=\"_blank\">distributed under the GPLv2 or later</a> and can be modified by anyone to add more personality to the character.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Thanks to the freedom of the GPL, there have been many <a href=\"http://jawordpressorg.github.io/wapuu/\" target=\"_blank\">forked versions of Wapuu</a>,&#8221; Nishikawa said. &#8220;All local Wapuus are created by someone who belongs to each local community and they hold something that represents where they are from.&#8221;</p>\n<a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/local-wapuu.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/local-wapuu.jpg?resize=627%2C349\" alt=\"photo credit:  Naoko Takano - WordPress History\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43943\" /></a>photo credit:<br />Naoko Takano &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/naokomc/wordpress-history-21925968/42\">WordPress History</a>\n<p>Wapuu is so well-loved that the creature ends up making its way onto <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/odysseygate/8509556933/\" target=\"_blank\">swag</a>, cakes, and nail and coffee art at Japanese WordPress events.</p>\n<a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wapuu-everywhere.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wapuu-everywhere.jpg?resize=1025%2C703\" alt=\"photo credit:  Naoko Takano - Learnings from Growing Local WordPress Communities\" class=\"size-full wp-image-43945\" /></a>photo credit:<br />Naoko Takano &#8211; <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/naokomc/wordcamp-europe2013/47\">Learnings from Growing Local WordPress Communities</a>\n<p>The name &#8220;Wapuu&#8221; was given to the mascot by a users&#8217; poll. &#8220;Japanese people pronounce WordPress as &#8216;WAADOPURESU,\'&#8221; Nishikawa said. &#8220;Wapuu sounds like an abbreviation of WAADOPURESU, taking &#8216;Wa&#8217; and &#8216;Pu&#8217; from it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Modifications of the mascot have recently started popping up at WordCamps outside of Japan. <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/scott-evans-on-designing-the-punk-wapuu-for-wordcamp-london-2015\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp London&#8217;s wapuunk</a> was so popular that it inspired WordCamp Philly and <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/meet-wapuujlo-official-mascot-of-wordcamp-belgrade\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Belgrade</a> to create their own unique modifications to the character.</p>\n<p>For whatever reason, Wapuu seems to have a special power to bring people together, regardless of culture or location. WordPress has the Japanese community to thank for its unique open source contribution to meetup branding.</p>\n<h2>The Challenges of Contributing to WordPress Across the Language Barrier</h2>\n<p>Despite having a large WordPress community thriving in Japan, with many of the <a href=\"http://www.sailor.co.jp/\" target=\"_blank\">top</a> <a href=\"http://womens.marathon-festival.com/2014/\" target=\"_blank\">websites</a> <a href=\"http://tasukeaijapan.jp/\" target=\"_blank\">built</a> on the <a href=\"http://www.kurashi-no-techo.co.jp/\" target=\"_blank\">software</a>, Japanese developers have a difficult time contributing back to core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Language is the biggest barrier,&#8221; Nishikawa told the Tavern. &#8220;There are many good developers in Japan (and in other countries) who don’t speak English. Most of them can read documentation but joining in the conversation in tickets and on Slack is a different thing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In my opinion, there is English for native speakers and English for international people, and they are different,&#8221; he explained.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s difficult to say how different they are, but for us who are not native, ambiguous words, abbreviations like &#8216;FWIW,&#8217; jokes, and slang are difficult,&#8221; Nishikawa said. &#8220;Sometimes nesting a long sentence in another long sentence by using &#8216;that,&#8217; &#8216;which,&#8217; and &#8216;including&#8217; is difficult.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He explained that overcoming the language barrier is more than simply learning English; it also includes the hurdle of trying to understand the abbreviations and expressions that are infused by the culture around native English speakers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;People would say that you can understand because it’s code, but if we look at the conversations in tickets, the surrounding discussion often concerns more than just the code,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Non-English speaking developers are trying to learn English, but it would be good if people in the ticket / Slack would keep in mind that there are people who don’t share the context or culture behind the words they write,&#8221; Nishikawa suggested.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we make the words and expressions easier to understand, someone who understands 80%  will have the opportunity to understand nearly 100%.&#8221;</p>\n<p>However, Nishikawa is unsure of whether or not it is productive to request these kinds of changes, given that communication can never really be separated from culture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Maybe a more welcoming atmosphere needed?&#8221; he said. &#8220;On the other hand, I know that the discussions include a great deal of context and many cultural things. It’s a place for communication, too. So, I don’t know if it’s right to say that something needs to change.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Additionally, there are many talented developers who don’t understand English at all and I have no idea what can be done for them,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Nishikawa said that he felt much more connected to the community after attending WordCamp San Francisco and the following summit and contributor day.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even for developers who didn&#8217;t speak English, we had translators and discussed things, looked at the code and shared the WordPress projects they are working on,&#8221; he said. &#8220;After these face-to-face conversations, developers are more relaxed and motivated to work in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">core Make project</a>. Inviting developers to meetups/camps in the English world or inviting core contributors travel and join local contribution days will be a big trigger to involve more people.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>The Future of WordPress in Japan</h2>\n<p>Nishikawa believes that WordPress has a bright future in Japan, thanks to the efforts of Otsukare, Naoko Takano, Takayuki Miyoshi and all the plugin developers, Tenpura (the author of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-multibyte-patch/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Multibyte Patch</a> plugin), bloggers, community organizers, an army of dedicated translators and more.</p>\n<p>He is hopeful that positive experiences for developers at global meetups like WCSF will help the Japanese WordPress community find ways to contribute back to core and other projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There have been a few people who had contributed separately, but now I feel there is a small groove of people who are more interested in contribution,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the community, we hope that the activeness of the Japanese community will be exported to other Asian (and global) communities, especially with Wapuu or the unique &#8220;more-than-learning&#8221; style of meetups.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also believes the future of WordPress in Japan will be brighter with the internationalization improvements that are continually being added to core.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For the users, when everything is translatable, people are happier. If WordPress can become more mobile friendly, it will be used more by young people. When the WP-API is in core, there will be more diverse apps available.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nishikawa has had such a positive experience organizing WordPress community events in Japan that he is now active in growing the community in Thailand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We now have meetups twice per month in Bangkok for developers/users/designers. We don’t have &#8216;session-oriented meetups&#8217; anymore but we try to have casual talks every time, where everyone can speak in their own languages. Translation is more than welcome but we don’t want to rely on someone.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As Japan&#8217;s community-oriented approach to learning has paid off with highly active meetup groups and some of the largest WordCamps on the globe, Nishikawa is hoping to bring his experience to Thailand and help organize a WordCamp Bangkok in the near future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Community has made my life/job much more exciting and fun,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Many things will differ culture by culture but the core value of community should be the same everywhere.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 18 May 2015 21:26:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Matt: 2 Chocolate Chip Cookies\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"http://ma.tt/?p=45056\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"http://ma.tt/2015/05/2-chocolate-chip-cookies/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:494:\"<blockquote><p>Sometimes, you just want 2 chocolate chip cookies.

WP Contributions comes with a series of <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-contributions/faq/\">template tags</a> for those who want more control over how the information is displayed.</p>\n<p>One thing I&#8217;d like to see in a future version is short code support. This way, users could create a WP Contributions page on their site with easy to use short codes. It&#8217;s not supported now, but Filippini informs me that a future version will include the ability to display badges attached to a WordPress.org user profile.</p>\n<p>As WordPress <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/\">continues to increase in marketshare</a>, the ability to show how much you&#8217;ve contributed to the project is a huge resume booster, especially if you can say your code runs on millions of sites. In early 2014, WordPress made substantial <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-profile-redesign-is-live\">improvements to user profiles</a> but there&#8217;s no easy way to display those contributions to a wider audience.</p>\n<p>WP Contributions does a decent job filling the void and is available for free on the WordPress.org plugin directory.

Lasso is sold through his storefront and is also in use on <a href=\"https://story.am/\" target=\"_blank\">Story.am</a>, the hosted platform for <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/?s=Aesop+Story+Engine\" target=\"_blank\">Aesop Story Engine</a>. Haskins recently <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/story-am-relaunches-now-100-free\" target=\"_blank\">made accounts on Story.am available for free</a> in hopes of garnering more feedback on the Lasso editing experience.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/building-with-lasso.gif\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/building-with-lasso.gif?resize=900%2C618\" alt=\"building-with-lasso\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43867\" /></a></p>\n<p>As of today, <a href=\"https://github.com/AesopInteractive/lasso\" target=\"_blank\">Lasso is now available on GitHub</a> for developers and users to test and offer feedback/contribution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This decision was several months in the making,&#8221; Haskins told the Tavern. &#8220;It included conversations with developers who have their commercially sold code publicly available, as well as A/B testing our presence to verify that the move would be both beneficial to the plugin, as well as the user base that it’s attracting.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Making the code public is a calculated risk, which he hopes will not damage sales of the plugin but rather increase its visibility. Haskins recently published a <a href=\"http://aesopinteractive.com/jan-april-2015-report/\" target=\"_blank\">financial transparency report</a> on his 15 month old company, which indicates that Aesop Interactive is on track to double its revenue in 2015 based on numbers from January &#8211; April. Sales of the Lasso product totaled $4,408.36.</p>\n<p>As the plugin is open source, you are free to use it anywhere, but Haskins notes that support will only be offered to customers:</p>\n<blockquote><p>If you have a suggestion, a bug report, or a patch for an issue, feel free to submit it here. We do ask, however, that if you are using the plugin on a live site that you please purchase a valid license from the website. We cannot provide support to anyone who does not hold a valid license key.</p></blockquote>\n<p>&#8220;I decided to make it public today after I was invited in to collaborate on another publicly available commercially sold plugin,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I just needed a final excuse, and that was it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Haskins is not the first developer to make a commercial WordPress product available on GitHub for contribution. Earlier this year, the folks behind GravityView decided to <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/gravityview-is-now-public-on-github\" target=\"_blank\">make their plugin public on GitHub</a> after being inspired by a <a href=\"https://mattreport.com/interview-matt-mullenweg/\" target=\"_blank\">discussion between Matt Medeiros and Matt Mullenweg</a> on ubiquity vs. scarcity as it relates to WordPress product businesses:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The one pattern I see most right now that I think is not sustainable is, and it’s because it’s the easiest thing to do, is businesses that are built on a scarcity – the thing not being widely available. If you think about some of the coolest successes so far in WordPress, the Gravity Forms, some of the theme businesses, they are inherently predicated on the fact that you have to pay to access them.</p>\n<p>I’ve always been a fan of businesses that grow with ubiquity, that become more powerful the more ubiquitous they are, more valuable. WordPress itself is one of these. Akismet is one of these. Jetpack is certainly one of those.</p></blockquote>\n<p>This approach brings up the question of whether or not a commercial plugin developer can run a successful business while giving the code away for free on GitHub. A select few are finding that the benefits of community contribution and feedback outweigh the risk.</p>\n<p>Haskin&#8217;s frontend editing plugin is a prime candidate to explore this approach, as this type of plugin was created for users of all technical skill levels. Customers interested in this functionality are less likely to be comfortable installing and updating plugins from GitHub. If you&#8217;ve been eager to try Lasso but couldn&#8217;t get past the <a href=\"https://lasso.is/pricing/\" target=\"_blank\">$129 price tag</a>, now is your opportunity to <a href=\"https://github.com/AesopInteractive/lasso\" target=\"_blank\">download the plugin</a> and put it through the paces.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 May 2015 20:22:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: SiteGround is Organizing Bulgaria’s First PHP Conference\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=43825\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wptavern.com/siteground-is-organizing-bulgarias-first-php-conference\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2868:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bulgaria-php-conference.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/bulgaria-php-conference.jpg?resize=670%2C287\" alt=\"bulgaria-php-conference\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43829\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.siteground.com\" target=\"_blank\">SiteGround</a> is organizing the first ever <a href=\"http://www.bgphp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bulgaria PHP conference to be held in Sofia</a>, September 25-27, 2015.

Both cultures are built on some of the same values, like sharing knowledge and open sourcing happiness. With the explosion of the craft beer scene over the past few years, many new <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/30-beautiful-brewery-websites-built-with-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">breweries are opting to build their websites on top of WordPress</a>. When you&#8217;re bootstrapping a new brewery, the last thing you need to spend money on is proprietary software.</p>\n<p>The WordPress community has many free and open source tools that developers can use to build a beer-centered website. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/beer-directory/\" target=\"_blank\">Beer Directory</a> is a new plugin released this year by Jami Gibbs, founder of <a href=\"https://rescuethemes.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Rescue Themes</a>. She created it to support beer listings on her commercial <a href=\"http://themeforest.net/item/brewery-a-wordpress-theme-for-beer-makers/full_screen_preview/10941216\" target=\"_blank\">Brewery</a> theme.</p>\n<p>Beer Directory gives you an easy way to enter beers and their details in the admin. It allows you to categorize and group beers, enter details, and display listings via a configurable shortcode. The post type includes fields for ABV, IBU, OG, FG, SRM/Color, Malts, Hops, and Yeast.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-profile.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-profile.jpg?resize=1025%2C797\" alt=\"beer-profile\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43790\" /></a></p>\n<p>I tested the plugin by adding the details from a <a href=\"https://www.brewtoad.com/recipes/put-the-blueberries-in-the-basket\" target=\"_blank\">blueberry sour beer recipe</a>. The output for an individual listing on the frontend will look something like this, depending on your active theme:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-listing.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-listing.jpg?resize=626%2C872\" alt=\"beer-listing\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43791\" /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes a shortcode for listing an individual beer: <code>[beer id=\"17\"]</code> and one for displaying all listings: <code>[beer]</code>. The shortcodes can be configured by count, category, id, and any of the WordPress <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters\" target=\"_blank\">Order &amp; Orderby Parameters</a>. Beer posts also include support for a featured image.</p>\n<p>Be advised that this is not a beer recipe plugin, so there&#8217;s no easy way to enter your hop schedule, amounts for fermentables, temperatures, etc. Beer Directory was created purely for listing beers on the frontend with a few key details. If you need to enter beer recipes, the <a href=\"http://wptavern.com/how-to-share-beer-recipes-in-wordpress\" target=\"_blank\">BeerXML Shortcode plugin</a>, created by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/derekspringer\" target=\"_blank\">Derek Springer</a>, is a more suitable option.</p>\n<p>The Beer Directory plugin is perfect for home brewers, professional breweries, or even beer enthusiasts who want to maintain a personal library of beers they enjoy. With this data saved in a custom post type, it will be transferable no matter how many times you change your WordPress theme. In addition to keeping track of your beers, the admin listing allows you to easily search and sort your library.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-in-the-admin.jpg\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/beer-in-the-admin.jpg?resize=1025%2C344\" alt=\"beer-in-the-admin\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-43807\" /></a></p>\n<p>After testing the plugin, I can confirm that it works as advertised. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/beer-directory/\" target=\"_blank\">Beer Directory</a> is fully translatable and available for free on WordPress.org. If you want to contribute to development, the plugin can also be found on <a href=\"https://github.com/RescueThemes/beer-directory\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 15 May 2015 01:31:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: cPanel’s Site Software Addon Disables WordPress Auto Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wptavern.com/?p=43609\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"http://wptavern.com/cpanels-site-software-addon-disables-wordpress-auto-updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8988:\"<p>A little more than two months ago, Derek Munson, who goes by the username <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/profile/drumology2001\">Drumology2001 </a>published a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-updates-not-showing-latest-wp-version-available?replies=34\">thread</a> in the WordPress.org support forums. While performing maintenance on several WordPress sites on his virtual private server, Munson discovered a number of them running outdated versions. Versions ranged from 3.9 to 4.1 with at least one site using WordPress 3.9.2.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m used to seeing the &#8216;nag&#8217; at the top of the screen that lets me know there&#8217;s a newer version available. I am not seeing that on any of these sites which aren&#8217;t on the newest version (4.1.1). When I go to Dashboard &gt; Updates and click &#8216;Check Again&#8217; to force a manual check, it&#8217;s still acting as though everything is up to date when it&#8217;s clearly not.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Initially, Munson thought All in One WP Security and Firewall <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/blocking-wp-core-file-updates\">was blocking update notifications</a>. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/profile/mbrsolution\">Mbrsolution</a>, the plugin&#8217;s main developer, confirmed that it doesn&#8217;t block update notifications. After completing a number of troubleshooting techniques suggested by volunteers on the WordPress support forum, Munson installed <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\">Wordfence Security</a>, a WordPress security plugin.</p>\n<p>One of Wordfence&#8217;s noteworthy features is its scanner. It compares clean WordPress core files to those on the server and notifies the user if it detects a difference. Results of the scan shows three files had been changed.</p>\n<p><strong>wp-admin/includes/update.php</strong><br />\n<strong>wp-admin/update-core.php</strong><br />\n<strong>wp-admin/includes/class-wp-upgrader.php</strong></p>\n<p>These files were only changed on WordPress sites that were installed using cPanel&#8217;s Site Software addon.</p>\n<p><strong>WordPress&#8217;</strong> update.php file.<br />\n<code>function get_core_updates( $options = array() ) { $options = array_merge( array( \'available\' =&gt; true, \'dismissed\' =&gt; false ), $options ); $dismissed = get_site_option( \'dismissed_update_core\' );</code></p>\n<p><strong>cPanel&#8217;s</strong> update.php file.<br />\n<code>function get_core_updates( $options = array() ) { # cPanel override: Disable all core updates to prevent conflict with cPAddons. return false; $options = array_merge( array( \'available\' =&gt; true, \'dismissed\' =&gt; false ), $options );</code></p>\n<p><strong>WordPress&#8217;</strong> update-core.php file.<br />\n<code>function core_upgrade_preamble() { global $wp_version, $required_php_version, $required_mysql_version; $updates = get_core_updates();</code></p>\n<p><strong>cPanel&#8217;s</strong> update-core.php file.<br />\n<code>function core_upgrade_preamble() { # cPanel override: Do not display the current or the latest version, because we\'ve disabled updates. return; global $wp_version, $required_php_version, $required_mysql_version; $updates = get_core_updates();</code></p>\n<p><strong>WordPress&#8217;</strong> class-wp-upgrader.php file.<br />\n<code>public function is_disabled() { // Background updates are disabled if you don\'t want file changes. if ( defined( \'DISALLOW_FILE_MODS\' ) &amp;&amp; DISALLOW_FILE_MODS ) return true;</code></p>\n<p><strong>cPanel&#8217;s</strong> class-wp-upgrader.php file.<br />\n<code>public function is_disabled() { return true; // Force this functionality to disabled because it is incompatible with cPAddons. // Background updates are disabled if you don\'t want file changes. if ( defined( \'DISALLOW_FILE_MODS\' ) &amp;&amp; DISALLOW_FILE_MODS ) return true;</code></p>\n<p>The code added by cPanel disables core WordPress updates, update notifications, and automatic background updates to point releases. Once Munson restored these files to their original version, automatic updates and notifications worked properly.</p>\n<h2>cPanel and cPAddons</h2>\n<p>Those who manage dedicated servers or virtual private servers with cPanel have the ability to use cPAddons. According to <a href=\"https://documentation.cpanel.net/display/1148Docs/Install+cPAddons\">cPanel documentation</a>, &#8220;Addons are applications that work with cPanel to perform functions for your users’ websites. Examples of these applications include bulletin boards, online shopping carts, and blogs.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Open Dialogue With cPanel</h2>\n<p>George Stephanis, a WordPress core contributor and lead developer of Jetpack publicly called out cPanel&#8217;s actions as a bad practice.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wait, seriously? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cPanel\">@cPanel</a> is hacking WordPress core to prevent updates?

Or email into sales @ cpanel dot net^MR</p>\n<p>&mdash; cPanel Cares (@cpanelcares) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cpanelcares/status/597886956945711107\">May 11, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Stephanis <a href=\"http://stephanis.info/2015/05/14/please-dont-hack-core/\">engaged in a lengthy conversation</a> with cPanel representatives explaining why it&#8217;s a bad idea to disable core updates. cPanel disables WordPress&#8217; native update system because it could cause conflicts with cPanel&#8217;s Site Software version of WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We generally release the latest version of WordPress within 1 to 5 days of the latest WordPress update. At a minimum, server administrators are informed each night of all Site Software applications that need updated. It is up to users to configure their notifications within cPanel to receive such updates.</p>\n<p>The way our cPAddons tool tracks software is not compatible with the way WordPress updates, hence why we disable the auto-updates so we can track it through cPAddons.</p></blockquote>\n<p>cPanel goes on to explain how updates are handled for software installed using its Site Software cPAddon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Whenever WP releases a maintenance build that addresses security concerns, we react very quickly to get our software updated to be available to customers.</li>\n<li>By default, we define that software managed/installed through cPAddons is automatically updated when a new update is available.</li>\n<li>Based on the above information, if the server administrator leaves the defaults enabled, once WP introduces a maintenance release that corrects security concerns and we’ve tested and updated our source for it, customers will receive the release automatically.</li>\n<li>If the server administrator decides to disable automatic software updates, the end-user and systems administrator will still receive notifications that their installation is out of date accompanied with steps on how to update their application.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By default, software installed by cPanel is configured to update automatically but some of Munson&#8217;s sites didn&#8217;t update. He also didn&#8217;t receive update notifications for those sites. cPanel believes there is something wrong with Munson&#8217;s server configuration and pledged to contact him to find out more information.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Based upon what Drumology2001 reported on the forum, it appears something is amiss on that server. We’d love to examine that server to determine why WordPress updates were not available to the user.</p>\n<p>Based upon the fuzzy dates used on the forum and compared with our internal records, the 4.1.1 update was available to the Site Software system prior to the initial post.

NMR gathers data about projects, performances, composers, musicians, software and hardware. It includes interviews with artists, articles, papers and reviews. It provides up-to-date information on conferences, workshops, competitions, and festivals. Fifteen experimental works were commissioned for NMR in 2008.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_80\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/i1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-80\" src=\"http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/i1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Thorington and Jo-Anne Green\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a> Helen Thorington and Jo-Anne Green[/caption]\r\n\r\nIn 2008, NRPA and its project partners created Networked: a (networked_book) about (networked_art); the goal was\r\nto develop and publish an online, trans-disciplinary book that would address recent artistic developments made\r\npossible by computers and mobile connectivity. Networked proposes that a history or critique of interactive\r\nand/or participatory art must itself be interactive and/or participatory; that the technologies used to create a\r\nwork suggest new forms a \"text\" might take. We commissioned five chapters and published them online using\r\nWiki/blog technology to enable the public to revise, update, debate and translate them. Additional chapters have\r\nbeen added since the project launched on August 1, 2009.\r\n<blockquote class=\"fl\">Throughout its 33-year history NRPA has made public presentations of artistic work a signi ficant part of its\r\nactivity.</blockquote>\r\nNew Radio and Performing Arts, Inc. (NRPA) was founded in New York City in 1981 to foster the development of new\r\nand experimental work for radio and sound arts. In 1996, it extended its mandate to net art and launched its\r\npioneering web site, Turbulence.org. In March 2002, NRPA opened an office in Boston to extend the geographic\r\nreach of its existing programs and explore new ones, and continue to build its audience for experimental sound\r\nand net art.\r\n\r\nNow celebrating its 33rd year of service to artists, NRPA has a distinguished history in two experimental fields,\r\nradio art (New American Radio] and net art; it has commissioned ($1,200,000 +), distributed and archived\r\nhundreds of works, thereby supporting and advancing many artists\' careers, and establishing itself as a vital\r\nresource for arts and educational institutions, and the general public. It is the only organization in the\r\nUnited States that has as its core mission the commissioning of networked art by both emerging and established\r\nartists.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_81\"

NMR gathers data about projects,\nperformances, composers, musicians, software and hardware. It includes interviews with artists, articles, papers\nand reviews. It provides up-to-date information on conferences, workshops, competitions, and festivals. Fifteen\nexperimental works were commissioned for NMR in 2008.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_80\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\"]<a href=\"http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/i1.jpg\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-80\" src=\"http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/i1-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"Helen Thorington and Jo-Anne Green\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" /></a> Helen Thorington and Jo-Anne Green[/caption]\n\nIn 2008, NRPA and its project partners created Networked: a (networked_book) about (networked_art); the goal was\nto develop and publish an online, trans-disciplinary book that would address recent artistic developments made\npossible by computers and mobile connectivity. Networked proposes that a history or critique of interactive\nand/or participatory art must itself be interactive and/or participatory; that the technologies used to create a\nwork suggest new forms a \"text\" might take. We commissioned five chapters and published them online using\nWiki/blog technology to enable the public to revise, update, debate and translate them. Additional chapters have\nbeen added since the project launched on August 1, 2009.\n<blockquote class=\"fl\">Throughout its 33-year history NRPA has made public presentations of artistic work a signi ficant part of its\nactivity.</blockquote>\nNew Radio and Performing Arts, Inc. (NRPA) was founded in New York City in 1981 to foster the development of new\nand experimental work for radio and sound arts.

After earning his engineer diploma from the Telecom Paris in 1984, he worked as programming engineer specialised in artificial intelligence and human-machine interactions, in Paris, especially for the company Act Informatique for five years (1985–1991), and in Silicon Valley as an R&D engineer for the NeXT company with Steve Jobs for three years (1991–1994). He has been technical assistant to the film-maker Chris Marker, and collaborated with the companies Hyptique, Incandescence, Virtools, the BBC and more recently with violet. He creates specialised software, especially Xtras (plugins) of Adobe Director, like the asFFT Xtra. Since 1994, he has worked as a visual artist, recognised by numerous awards and exhibitions. Artist of the movement, digital artist, Schmitt develops his work around the notion of shapes \"programmed to be free\". His artworks, minimal, abstract and efficient, tackle contemporary or intemporal themes like the condition of being free, the systems of reality or the forces and their shape. He places programming, an artistic medium that he considers as radically new because of its active dimension, at the heart of the majority of his creations. Using techniques coming from artificial life and intelligence, influenced by philosophical and psychoanalytical approaches, Schmitt crafts objects or situations, generative or interactive physical, visual or audio systems, which question the modalities of the free human being in a complex world. Also, alone or though collaborations, Schmitt confronts his approach with more established artistic fields like dance, music, cinema, architecture or literature, and revisits their codes.','Antoine Schmitt','','publish','open','open','','antoine-schmitt','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/antoine-schmitt/','0','artist','','0'),('151','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','Antonio Mendoza','','publish','open','open','','antonio-mendoza','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/antonio-mendoza/','0','artist','','0'),('152','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Aram Sinnreich is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and author from New York City.

Until he was 13, he had no idea what direction his life would take, but in 1989, he received a comic book from his mother about computers which fatefully changed the course of his life. From that point on, he was constantly studying the art of telling machines what to do. Artem’s early learning was through the library and in computer club in school until 1993, when he entered the Moscow Power-Engineering Institute, where he studied system design and computer science. During his university years, his interests varied from artificial intelligence and statistics to complex systems, simulation, and computer aided software engineering. He received a bachelor degree in computer science in 1997 and continued his studies until 1999 when he received a computer systems engineer diploma and began working at a little enterprise in Smolensk, Russia, developing firmware for a SCADA system used in electric power systems, natural gas distributing systems, and in trains. At the same time, he was experimenting with programming computer graphics and music at home, in his free time - mostly at nights. Since the last years of his study, Artem has acquainted himself with the world of free software: GNU/Linux operating system. In a year, he passed the phases of initial curiosity about the phenomenon, enjoying freely available high-quality software and finally understanding the underlying principles and ideology. His first contributions to the free software world were translations of some documentation into Russian for the BestLinux distribution. In November 1999, Artem discovered on the Internet a new fascinating free software project - v2os - operating system written from scratch by the coder of the v2_lab, Joost Faassen. The OS was positioned as a perfect environment for demos, such as the little graphics and sound applications he was writing as a hobby, so he decided to give it a try. Not only did he want to use the OS, but he also tried to fix its problems that he kept running into. Two months later, he was hired by the lab and after another half year, moved to the Netherlands. Since then, Artem has worked as a programmer in the v2_lab, using his skills to help media artists make their dreams a reality. His areas of expertise are computer graphics, video programming and low-level programming in collaboration with Stock, the lab hardware engineer. He has also been involved in the CodeZebra project, designing system architecture and coordinating the work of the lab\'s CodeZebra team with the rest of the world.','Artem Baguinski','','publish','open','open','','artem-baguinski','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/artem-baguinski/','0','artist','','0'),('155','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Artists Meeting is a group of artists who create interventions and events. Through a series of discussions both online and in regular meetings, the group determines the viability of each project as it comes up and how to proceed. The process is partially by consensus but also depends on different members taking the lead or directing the project as it develops. Some processes demand a lot of hands in a group effort and reflect different ideas, other projects are executed according to a single vision. Often Artists Meeting projects begin as proposals to a selected venue, such as an art fair, gallery, or festival. This allows the group to imagine different approaches and determine parameters for the work. As the proposals are accepted the project is executed. Other projects remain unexecuted but often resurface as part of another proposal or in work that is in process. In other words nothing is ever lost. Every bit of information and creative energy is retrieved when appropriate.The group represents a range of creative talents including sculpture and installation artists, computer programmers and hackers, traditional painters, videographers, photographers, musicians, sound and performance artists. Some work is political and some is apolitical, but the assumption is that creating art in the face of all the obstacles facing artists is a political act. Artists Meeting began with the desire to expand the definition of art and the creative act using digital and traditional tools in a collaborative manner. Over the course of working together, the group methodology and style is constantly evolving.','Artists Meeting','','publish','open','open','','artists-meeting','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/artists-meeting/','0','artist','','0'),('156','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Asi Burak co-founded ImpactGames to influence society and promote change through interactive media.

Since 1982 she has worked with the specific physical and contextual properties of a given site, be it art gallery, museum, atrium, tower, radio airwaves and now the internet, in developing and presenting her works. After completing undergraduate degrees in fine arts and art history, Barbara Campbell was awarded a Master of Visual Arts from Sydney College of the Arts, The University of Sydney in 1998. She has undertaken residencies at Griffith University, Queensland, The University of Melbourne, The University of Sydney and the Australia Council studios in Santa Monica and New York. In 1994 the NSW Ministry for the Arts awarded her the Women and Arts Fellowship and in 2004 she received one of four Fellowship grants awarded by the Visual Arts/Craft Board of the Australia Council for the Arts. Prior to 1001 nights cast, Barbara Campbell’s most recent performance/ exhibition was The Grimwade Effect at the Ian Potter Museum of Art, University of Melbourne in October-December, 2003. This project was the result of her Macgeorge Fellowship at the University of Melbourne in 2002. The Grimwade Effect was reconfigured at the CraftACT Gallery, Canberra for Metis in May 2004. Between 1996 and 2001 Campbell developed and presented work at various sites around The University of Sydney. These came together in the survey exhibition Flesh Winnow, in 2002. The accompanying collection of essays of the same name was published jointly by the Department of Performance Studies and the Power Institute: Foundation for Art and Visual Culture of The University of Sydney. Although performance art is by its nature ephemeral, artefacts and objects created in and around Campbell’s performances are in the collections of the National Gallery of Australia; Griffith University; Queensland University; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney; the State Library of Queensland and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. She was also commissioned to create Cameral, a public art work for the ACT Legislative Assembly, Canberra in 2001.','Barbara Campbell','','publish','open','open','','barbara-campbell','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/barbara-campbell/','0','artist','','0'),('162','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Barbara Lattanzi has presented Muscle and Blood Piano, experimental software for moving-image performance, at the Wisconsin Film Festival, the 2001 \"Ready to...\" conference in Prague, Czech Republic; and the 2002 European Media Art Festival, Osnabruck, Germany.

On their shared blog and website, an ongoing dialogue occurs that explores the implications of the Internet on culture and life. A particular focus is placed upon the way in which their generation is being socialized through this medium and its effects on mass culture. Using a syntax that transcends language, their website speaks through the use of a variety of formats available to the technology, including pictures, videos, sound, and code. Acknowledging the reach of the Internet into the physical world, the group has since expanded beyond its initial impulse to include work in a variety of mediums including film and performance.

At the time this shift seemed to be an act of schizophreny, but it all started to make sense when I was given the opportunity to work at the media lab of V2_, Institute for the Unstable Media in 2001. For 5 years I worked there with great passion on a number of international collaborative art and research projects concerning interconnected multi-user environments, non-linear storytelling, 2D and 3D graphics, and developed an expertise in immersive and virtual reality environments. These include DataCloud 2 and 2.5, Amicitia, nybble-engine-toolZ, playList, GATC/life, taxi-onomy and The Mechanics of Emotions. In 2006 I started to work at the R&D department of Almende where I worked with computer scientists on projects concerning self-organization, artificial intelligence and wireless sensor networks. At the same time I kept working on art projects and was involved in organizing/curating lectures, workshops and seminars about perception, immersive environments and mixed realities. In november 2006, I got involved with the virtual world Second Life, and started exploring the potential of the platform as the avatar Evo Szuyuan. Initially drawn to the Second Life platform as a cheap means for protopying, I soon got involved in other ways as I was learning about places, people and projects that used the platform in interesting and innovative ways. In Second Life I started organizing and curating Dorkbot sessions, and in order to show the more interesting projects in this virtual world to a wider audience I started to document these using the so-called machinima technique. These videos were screened at the Rome Filmfest, nominated for several categories at the European Machinima Festival, and received with such enthousiasm, that I soon got overwhelmed with requests for them. In 2008 I left Almende and founded Creative Machinery, to be able to do the machinimatography for the project Fly me / Volavola\", for which 2 featurelength movies are made. One entirely shot in a virtual world, and the second in a mixed reality setup shot both in Second Life, and in Rome. Around the end of 2008 I started to work part time at CrossLab, the cross media lab of the Willem de Kooning arts academy. I\'m also proud to be a member of Avatar Orchestra Metaverse, Not Possible in Real Life, and the Odyssey Art and Performance simulator.\n\n','Brigit Lichtenegger','','publish','open','open','','brigit-lichtenegger','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/brigit-lichtenegger/','0','artist','','0'),('177','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Brion Moss, being an engineer by training and vocation, first entered the art world through his participation in the conceptualization and creation of The Impermanence Agent. He is currently employed as a computer geek by IGN/Gamespy.','Brion Moss','','publish','open','open','','brion-moss','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/brion-moss/','0','artist','','0'),('178','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Brooke A.

Later, I lost interest in working live, and my present work has a resemblance to traditional moviemaking. Through all these phases of development, I have always used elements of physical assemblage, as well as a bizarre satirical humor. Assemblage always seemed an unparalleled imaginative outlet. Combine it with techniques purloined from the worlds of puppetry, theatrical illusion and video-graphic special effects, and the hidden lives of inert, neglected objects are revealed: an old, dirty dish-sponge becomes a jealous boyfriend; Styrofoam packing materials and broken kitchen implements are skyscrapers in bustling cities; a desiccated orange rind is a whirling dancer in a 1970s variety showcase; moth-eaten carpet-padding is a desert wasteland that a protagonist must traverse on horseback.

The work emphasizes video’s capacity as a live medium and the illusory architecture of layered video projection in space. The moving image is spatially mapped onto a site, compositing in real space. The seamless cinematic distance of pre-edited film viewing is ruptured by the awareness that the moving image is being constructed in the moment. The more recent works have introduced the live presence of dancers into this layered landscape, mediating the body while preserving the dynamic edge of the live performer. The performances are immersive environments that often explore a de-centralized performance space that supports an integrated reciprocal exchange between sound, image, movement, space. She has exhibited and performed widely in the US and abroad. Venues include the Museum of Modern Art-New York, Museum of Contemporary Art-Los Angeles, REDCAT/Disney Hall, the Getty Center, Trampoline: Platform for New Media Art (Nottingham, England), the Stanford Jazz Festival, Engine 27 (New York), Arizona State University-West Interdisciplinary Arts & Performance Program (Phoenix, AZ), the Knitting Factory (LA), ArtSonje Center (Seoul, Korea) plus numerous festivals and performance series.

In 1974, she was co-founder of Care of the Cow, a cutting-edge performance group which developed quite a following through the early 1980s. During 1981\'s Like Feeding Pork to Pigs, Baczewska had a breakthrough: the home of the human voice is the brain. Ultimately, the expanding voice can be made to take any shape, fill any space, or convey any message. Her focus on the voice and solo performance evolves from this experience.

While studying at NYU his interests shifted from narrative film forms to abstract video and audio work. After graduating he produced his first video/audio installation Flow/Flux 88, supported in part by a Paul Lambert Video Production Award Grant. In order to approach electronic based art as a fluid medium (e.g. painting) he then began to acquire the tools necessary to create the work outside of the pressures of commercial studios. In 1989 he co organized, with two other artists, XFH, an artist run gallery and petrie dish for underground culture in New York City. There he curated film and video screenings, and created several audio and video installations. Through XFH, Eric met electronic musician Charles Cohen, with whom he formed The Luminists in 1990. Elaborating upon previous experiments with highly processed video feedback, Eric took his work out of the context of the studio into a live performance milieu. With The Luminists he began developing real-time improvisations of abstract video and audio, performed live in front of an audience In early 1991, Eric co founded the intermedia performance group 77 Hz (with Benton Bainbridge, Phil Bonner, Jonathan Giles, and Michael Schell). 77 Hz was primarily a performance project featuring live creation and manipulation of video images, combined with electronic music and theatrical performances. Also in 1991 he was an artist-in-residence at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at New York University, and completed the video wall tape Burning Bush. In 1992 Eric Co-founded ESMP (Evolution of Sensory and Metabolic Probabilities) with MR Petit & P. Bonner, a multimedia performance group, utilizing electronic music, computer processed video, and anthropomorphic robotics. Eric left 77 Hz in 1993, and formed another performance duo, Diver Gone, with Jonathan Giles in 1994. Diver Gone worked with electronic media but the impulses were more DADA collage than previous projects: they often worked with visual and aural cut-ups of obscure popular culture. Eric ventured into the medium of CD ROM in 1995, co producing North Country an interactive narrative written by Helen Thorington and produced by New Radio and Performing Arts. He later co-created (design and HTML programming) the World Wide Web version of North Country, as well as assisting with the Turbulence Artist\'s Web Site and designing the interface for Turbulence\'s 9 Points of Entry project. In 1997 Eric moved from New York to Berlin, Germany and began work with choreographer and intermedia director Frauke Havemann. He has been technical director of Havemann\'s productions starting with Tripping on the Tongue in 1998 until the present day. In 2000 they collaborated on the video installations Lizard\'s Lounge and Excerpts From. In 2002 they formed the production group ON AIR (www.onairproductions.info) with performer Neal Wach. Since then, a series of works have been developed which investigate the flux and friction between Live-performance (human time, transformation/ change) and pre-recorded material (mechanical/digital time, the option for endless repetition). Within these parameters of narrative and multi-layered montage the audience becomes co-producer, co-writer, co-storyteller. Performances include Hotel Radio (2002), Leatherback (2004) and Truckers and Trackers (2006), as well as the installations Carwash (2002) and A Number (2007). ON AIR has performed in numerous festivals and performance spaces throughout Europe. Since 1998 he has also worked as a video and film editor in Germany on documentary films such as. \"Gendernauts\" by Monika Treut, and \"The Nomi Song\" by Andrew Horn.','Eric Schefter','','publish','open','open','','eric-schefter','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/eric-schefter/','0','artist','','0'),('248','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Erik Belgum is a writer of experiential fiction and an audio artist.

Founded by Andrew Shoben in 1993, Greyworld does interactive urban art for \"the people who buy cans of beans,\" not for the elite; and their installations involve the public as much as possible. Their most recent work, Bins and Benches, involves six or seven park benches installed at various locations in a park in Cambridge, England, and close by, the same number of bins positioned to collect rubbish. But this street furniture is very different. Each bench and bin is able to roam freely in the space, interacting with the other species that inhabit their world. \"In many ways Greyworld represents the shape of things to come. The hybrid mix of artist, designer, urban planner and musician, producing works that create new spaces for play, fun and contemplation - making manifest things which previously might only have been allowed space in the far corners of our imaginations.\" (Clive Gilman) Andrew Shoben is a former lecturer at the Royal College of Art, and is a visiting Professor to several Universities in the UK and the US.

At the University of Delaware and the Naropa Institute for the Arts, he studied English, video, photography, creative writing and dance. John then began to create taped soundtracks for his solo performance-art/dance pieces, that later developed into audio, audio-video, and mixed-media pieces. Language has also been a predominant focus, and John has studied and published haiku poetry, the literary equivalent of the reductive, minimal, and nature-based sound forms that interest him. John’s current work focuses on the rhythms and melodies that exist in our daily aural environments. These sounds usually remain hidden, as we tend to overlook their musical qualities; or, their musical qualities are obscured through mixture with other sounds. This work takes the form of audio CDs, web-based projects, mixed-media installations and performances. In simplified terms, what John is doing could be considered reframing and transforming sound in our environment so it can be noted, admired, and valued.','John Hudak','','publish','open','open','','john-hudak','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/john-hudak/','0','artist','','0'),('316','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Ca. 1980, Brooklyn-based artist John Klima (b. 1965) attempted to code a 3D maze on a TRS-80 with 4k RAM and failed miserably, but has been obsessed with 3D graphics ever since. Contracting for companies such as Microsoft, Turner Broadcasting, and Dun & Bradstreet from 1993 to 1998, Klima honed his programming skills while continuing to make art within the flexible schedule that free-lance programming provided. In 1998, Klima discontinued activities as a commercial programmer to focus solely on the creation of art software. Klima mounted his first solo exhibition in February 2001 at Postmasters Gallery and has opened his second solo show at Postmasters in November 2003. His work has been shown at European festivals, such as VIPER (Switzerland) and EMAF (Germany). His work glasbead was included in the \"New Media New Face\" exhibit at the ICC in Tokyo, Japan (1999) and received the Golden Lasso Award for Art in the Web3DRoundup at SIGGRAPH 2000 in New Orleans. His work ecosystm, commissioned by Zurich Capital Markets, was shown at the Whitney Museum as part of the exhibition BitStreams (2001). Klima\'s recent work, EARTH - previewed at the National Library of Medicine on May 21, 2001, and at SIGGRAPH 2001 in Los Angeles - was included in the 2002 Whitney Biennial. In 2002, he received a grant from the Langlois Foundation for his project Terrain Machine. By drawing upon gaming and the various possibilities of manipulating and transliterating data, John Klima\'s work occupies new territory in media art. Although there is an obvious connection between gaming and interactive digital art, and the gaming industry has played an important role in the development of multi-user environments, the parameters of this connection are rarely subjected to serious aesthetic investigation. Employing a variety of technologies to produce both hardware and software, Klima\'s work consistantly connects the virtual to the real, addressing issues of remote responsibility, and bluring the distinctions between the simulated and the concrete.','John Klima','','publish','open','open','','john-klima','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/john-klima/','0','artist','','0'),('317','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','John Lester, more commonly known as Pathfinder Linden in Second Life, joined Linden Lab (the creators of Second Life) in 2005, bringing experience in online community development as well as a background in the fields of healthcare and education.

He has also led the monster-metal art rock group Ebola Soup since 1993, and has toured the US and Europe as bassist with the noise/rock/improv trio the Molecules. As an improvising guitarist, Shiurba has developed a unique and personalized approach to the instrument. Through the use of extended techniques and unusual preparations, he expands the traditional sound range of the instrument, producing stunning, often unrecognizable results. He has played with internationally acclaimed musicians such as Eugene Chadbourne, Marc Ribot and Peter Van Bergen, as well as many of the finest West Coast improvisers-- Gino Robair, Dan Plonsey, Carla Kihlstedt, Myles Boisen, Tim Perkis, and Matthew Sperry to name a few.

At sixteen, Black River Review first published his work; subsequently, small press journals like Whiskey Island, the Coventry Reader, andLost and Found Times published LaCook\'s poetry. While attending Kent State University in the mid-to-late nineties, LaCook developed a passion for music, and played in several bands. Chad Mossholder of the ambient techno duo Twine was an early band mate. During this time LaCook continued to write poetry and publish in the small presses, culminating in 2000 when anabasis press published his long poem Cling as a chapbook. In the late nineties LaCook discovered the internet, and was immediately struck by how easily he might combine his two passions, music and poetry, into a cohesive whole. After the unexpected and tragic death of a close friend in 1999, LaCook barricaded himself in an apartment in Kent, Ohio, and taught himself the rudiments of HTML. It was during this period that LaCook also began collaborating with the poet Sheila Murphy; their long poem, Beyond the Bother of Sunlight, has appeared in excerpts in several small press venues, but has yet to be published in its entirety. As LaCook\'s use of the internet increased, his focus began to shift from using the medium as a multimedia and distributive tool to exploring it for its own sake. In 2001 he left Kent State University to live with his fiancee Renee Vaverchak in Richmond, Virginia. While there, he began teaching himself basic programming skills, and began using Macromedia\'s Flash authoring tool to realize his vision of an interactive hypermedia poetry. His early works in this genre met with some success; Rhizome.org began accepting his works into their artBase in 2002, and online venues like CTheory Multimedia, Cauldron and Net, Artifacts at Web Del Sol, 3rd Bed and Slope presented his works on their web sites.

The group solders custom audio circuits live, creating audible fluctuations of electricity with these bare elements. Gradually building a complex sound circuit, they present electronic music in a form closer to a physical instrument than a laptop. Their performances invite the audience to bear conscious witness to each musical gesture: the addition of a microchip; the soldering of an output pin to the audio jack. The New York City-based trio (Kunal Gupta, Tristan Perich, Katie Shima) stage their lush noise constructions with soldering irons on top of overhead projectors, slide projectors, flourescent light towers, and remodeled guitars. Formed in 2005 at Columbia University, the Loud Objects have since skirted between the worlds of noise rock, contemporary music, circuit-bending, and chiptunes, playing at Brooklyn house parties, collaborating with new music ensembles, exhibiting at electronic arts festivals and galleries, and serenading Rhode Island from the trunk of their car. Musically, the Loud Objects explore the sound of electricity, synthesized by microchips and amplified by speakers. Writing their own code to generate sound, they work with audio at the sample level, without utilizing subsequent effects or filters. From silence to a full onslaught of noise, they compositionally weave shifting sonic patterns, often juxtaposed with an accompanying acoustic instrument or yelling audience participation, further exposing electronic sound as a physical medium.','Loud Objects','','publish','open','open','','loud-objects','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/loud-objects/','0','artist','','0'),('362','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','LoVid (Tali Hinkis and Kyle Lapidus) overwhelms the senses with new media in their performances, videos, objects, and installations.

Typically he produces short looping films and directed performances which are presented together with appropriated objects, imagery or data. Contra-Invention (an exhibition of the photographs traffic wardens take as proof of parking violation) was invited to Les Rencontres Internationales de la Photographie d\'Arles 2011, subsequently nominated for the Deutsche Börse Photography Prize 2012 and part of From Here On at Arts Santa Mónica, Barcelona in 2013. Thanks to Arts Council England and other funding sources the show also toured Britain and Ireland in 2012/13. The original catalogue for Contra-Invention was included in Martin Parr\'s Best Book List in 2010 and O’Connell is now part of of ABC Artists\' Books Cooperative which advocates the use of Print on Demand approaches as well as querying the status of publishing and book production generally. Work from his recent project Missing You was exhibited in Macclesfield, supported again by Arts Council England, in 2014. A public event was run to coincide with the show, entitled From Jacquard to JPEG, at the famous Silk Heritage Centre with artists Rut Blees Luxemburg and Mishka Henner. In recent months the artist\'s film Delivering was screened in Birmingham as part of Turtle Salon, initiated by producer and director Michael Shamberg, and along with another work Recay is now formally part a that collection. Strategies include investigation of everyday functional processes, attempts to misunderstand (or re-understand), tinkering with systems and inventing new routines and procedures of various sorts. The mediation of human relationships through technology, the curious dynamics, feedback loops involved and ritualistic aspects are of more interest than any concern about what is ominous, worries about surveillance say.

Sobell began using video in the \'70s as a way to study spectators\' interactions with her sculptures, which were placed anonymously in public areas. Exploring video-sculpture, Sobell was intrigued with creating psycho-social transformations via video technology, making environments and mobile structures to physically engage the viewer. Pursuing video’s relation to the subconscious led Sobell to her well-known Brainwave Drawing piece, in which a screen monitor registered the brainwaves of two people and their silent attempt to communicate with each other. Most recently, she has been an AIDS activist, producing the first live viewer-directed AIDS information telecast for TV. She is in the process of creating an interactive AIDS information CD, a virtual brainwave drawing reality, and animating her neo-primitive sculptures via video computer. “Working with time, perception, exploring cognitive theories as art, led me further into the non-static world of video. At this point, I needed to retreat into an intimate personal dialogue, making sculpture for video camera space only, compressing time and private experience.”','Nina Sobell','','publish','open','open','','nina-sobell','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/nina-sobell/','0','artist','','0'),('433','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Niv (\"neeev\") Bavarsky is an artist/ illustrator/ person living in CA\'s Bay Area.

He was born in 1970 in Washington DC but has been based in New York City for many years. He is the son of one of Howard University\'s former Deans of Law who died when he was only three, and a mother who was in charge of a fabric shop of international repute. Paul Miller then spent the main part of his childhood in Washington DC’s nurturing bohemia. Paul Miller is a Professor at the European Graduate School (EGS) where he teaches Music Mediated Art. DJ Spooky is known amongst other things for his electronic experimentations in music known as both “illbient” and “trip hop.” His first album, Dead Dreamer, was released in 1996 and he has since then released over a dozen albums. He was the first editor of Artbyte: The Magazine of Digital Arts, which has since ceased publication. Miller’s articles have widely been published in, for example, The Source, The Village Voice, Artforum, Paper Magazine, Rap Pages, and many other magazines and journals.','Paul Miller (aka DJ Spooky)','','publish','open','open','','paul-miller-aka-dj-spooky','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/paul-miller-aka-dj-spooky/','0','artist','','0'),('452','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Paul Slocum is a musician and new media artist living in Dallas.

He studied contemporary philosophy in the mid 80\'s. After his study he became active in the Amsterdam vj-scene. He started fiddling with computers, and made 3D animations in commercial jobs. He also directed video- clips. Unsatisfied with commercial jobs and his role of only doing images and video with music made by others he started to combine video with his own music. In 1995 the character of his work changes dramatically when he discovers the net and the relative easy way interactivity could be achieved by using webpages. After doing some obscure net performances, Luining first got international recognition with his work \"clickclub\", which he presented at the Transmediale festival in Berlin. This netpiece distinguished itself from nearly everthing at that time because of the way the user could and could not interact with its sounds and images. Since 1997 Luining\'s work is turning towards a kind of minimalism, while maintaining his earlier research of the dynamics of the net. An important milestone in his work is BGO MUI*5 (2002), an interactive public artwork for the Dutch Department of Justice. Inspired by the problems he faced by setting up this large public artwork his work starts to become more conceptual which also means that he starts to theorize and write about the use of computers and it\'s basic material computersoftware. Peter Luining\'s work has been widely exhibited internationally. Recent presentations include: Transmediale 2012, Berlin/ Gogbot 2011, Enschede/ STRP festival, Eindhoven, the Netherlands/ Gemak, the Hague, the Netherlands/ Festival de Arte Digital, Belo Horizonte, Brazil/ Art Amsterdam and Mediumturm Graz, Austria.

After years of juggling parallel interests in technology and the arts, Pierre tired of the schizophrenia and finally discovered that it was socially acceptable, in fact highly desirable, to merge the two. Consequently he has taken on the ambitious task of rendering computers accountable to our sometimes misplaced but inevitable humanity. Proske\'s work involves exposing the unspoken relationships we have with technology and harnessing machines into exploring new aesthetics. He has exhibited or performed in Australia, Sweden., Brazil, Japan and the Netherlands. Having studied Electrical Engineering and Liberal Arts at the University of Melbourne, Australia, Pierre spent 4 years in Sweden where he performed, exhibited and obtained a Master of Science in Art and Technology from Chalmers University.

His investigation of BA and \"borrowed intelligence\" has lead to studying the inter-relationship between art (making and experiencing), behavior, and cognition. Cognition is, of course, a broad category, encompassing human, nonhuman and synthetic (computer) development. Regarding behavior, linguistics includes nonverbal communication and music theories.

Each instrument consists of a laptop, a multi-channel hemispherical speaker, and a variety of control devices (keyboards, graphics tablets, sensors, etc…). The students who make up the ensemble act as performers, researchers, composers, and software developers. The challenges are many: what kinds of sounds can they create?; how can they physically control these sounds?; how do they compose with these sounds? There are also social questions with musical and technical ramifications: how do they organize a dozen players in this context? with a conductor? via a wireless network? In its first year of PLOrk’s existence, composers and performers from Princeton and elsewhere developed new pieces for this unprecedented ensemble, including Paul Lansky (Professor of Music at Princeton), Brad Garton (Director of the Columbia Computer Music Center), PLOrk co-founders Dan Trueman and Perry Cook, and several graduate students. They have made extensive use of a new music programming language created by Princeton graduate student (now assistant professor at Stanford University|CCRMA) Ge Wang, called ChucK, which allows the performers to develop new code in performance. In their first major performance (April 2006, Richardson Auditorium) we were joined by the renowned tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain, legendary accordianist and composer Pauline Oliveros, and the exciting young percussion quartet from New York City, So Percussion.

Small sounds, small gestures -- made large. Inconsequential events -- made important. The vast difference made to a narrative by a small change in focus. Room acoustics, microphone/pickup placement, and amplification are often very important to his live construction of sound, where he places great weight on the embracing of unintended consequences - e.g. errors in translation/format conversion, bursts of feedback, power supply failures.','Richard Kamerman','','publish','open','open','','richard-kamerman','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/richard-kamerman/','0','artist','','0'),('474','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','Richard Matthew Stallman is a software developer and software freedom activist. Born in 1953, he attended Harvard starting in 1970 and graduated in 1974 with a Bachelor of Arts in physics. From September 1974 to June 1975 he was a graduate student in physics at MIT. He worked at the Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT from 1971 to 1984, learning operating system development by doing it, except for the year he was a graduate student. He wrote the first extensible Emacs text editor there in 1976, and developed the AI technique of dependency-directed backtracking, also known as truth maintenance. In 1983 Stallman announced the project to develop the GNU operating system, a Unix-like operating system meant to be entirely free software, and has been the project\'s leader ever since. With that announcement he also launched the Free Software Movement. Stallman began working on this project on January 5, 1984, resigning from MIT employment in order to do so. In October 1985 he started the Free Software Foundation, of which he is president as a full-time volunteer.','Richard Stallman','','publish','open','open','','richard-stallman','','','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','','0','http://demo.rtl.co.il/turbulence/artist/richard-stallman/','0','artist','','0'),('475','1','1970-01-01 00:00:00','1970-01-01 00:00:00','ROB COSHOW is an artist/photographer who recently graduated Magna Cum Laude from the Art Institute of Boston.

The training and assessment methodologies she is exploring include some that are largely automated, and which rely heavily on relatively novel computer vision algorithms to parameterize mobility changes as cheaply, independently and robustly as possible. Others, however, explore existing video technologies\' ability to cost-effectively shift clinical dialogs about functional mobility from hospitals to the home. Prior to joining IATSL, Sonya completed a Ph.D. at the Human Computer Interaction Institute of Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA) where she explored the application of similar, low-cost motion understanding technologies to upper limb assessment after stroke. This research was conducted under the umbrella of the recently founded “Quality of Life” Engineering Consortium joining CMU and the University of Pittsburgh. She has also held diverse positions at non-profit and industrial organizations, including Mitsubishi Engineering Research and gURL.com. In addition to research, Sonya has worked on collaborative artistic efforts (of a generally technological nature) with diverse arts groups including the New York City based ParkBench, and Pittsburgh\'s TnA. With ParkBench she worked on the Web Séance project, a piece which used bio-statistics to facilitate the formation of, and reveal subtleties in, a group identity; this was exhibited at The Banff Centre in 1999.

His commitment to genre-bending and technology-driven innovation in music has produced innumerable collaborations with artists that regularly cross musical and disciplinary boundaries, regularly placing him in venues from clubs to concert halls around the world.\n\nA forerunner in the expansion of the violin beyond its classical and ‘wood-bound’ tradition, Reynolds electrifies in concert, weaves together composed and improvised segments, and makes use of computer technology and digital loops to sculpt his sounds in real time, seamlessly integrating minimalist, pop, Jazz, Indian, African, Celtic and indigenous folk musics into his own sonic blend. As a cross-genre improviser and collaborator, he has appeared and/or recorded with such artists as Anthony Braxton, Uri Caine, John Cale, Steve Coleman, Joe Jackson, Dave Liebman, Yo-Yo Ma, Graham Nash, Greg Osby, Steve Reich, Marcus Roberts and Todd Rundgren, and has commissioned and premiered countless numbers of new works by America’s most compelling composers, including John King, Phil Kline, Michael Gordon, Neil Rolnick, Julia Wolfe, David Lang, Evan Ziporyn and Randall Wolff. His interdisciplinary work includes ongoing collaborations with SoundPainter Walter Thompson as well as media artists Bill Morrison and Luke DuBois and sound artist Jody Elff.\n\nReynolds is a founder of the band known as Ethel, a critically acclaimed amplified string quartet (represented by ICM Artists), with whom he wrote and toured internationally. He has also produced Still Life With Microphone, an ongoing theater piece which incorporates his own written and improvised music, compositions written for him, and elements of video and theatrical arts.

His work invites people to play in worlds that emerge from transmedia ecologies – complex systems of virtual and actual signs and entities. In his practice he has developed a unique aesthetic vocabulary that spans interaction, design, sculpture, animation, sound and installation. Innocent co-founded the digital arts collective Cyber Dada in 1989 and through pioneering works such as Idea-ON>! (1992) contributed to the Australian new media arts practice during the 90s. His interactive work Iconica (1998) was included in a retrospective at Campbelltown Arts Centre in 2013 as part of ISEA2013 alongside more recent collaborative work. He has exhibited and participated in international festivals, exhibition and symposia including Ars Electronica in 1992 and 2004. Innocent’s more recent public art practice manifests in mixed realities, such as an interactive sculpture garden entitled Colony (2008) in the Melbourne Docklands, Urban Codemakers (2010), an Alternate Reality Game that reinvents the history of Melbourne, and noemaflux, an ongoing work that has appeared on the streets of Ogaki, Instanbul, and Adelaide.

Users can choose between several authoring tools - called Spaces - that allow web users to annotate, modify and shift the content of a page and through ShiftSpace, share that shift with the rest of the web. Trails are maps of shifts (shiftspace content) that create meta-layer navigation across websites.
